<head><squote>STOP ELECTING LIFE PEERS</squote></head>
<head>By TREVOR WILLIAMS</head>
   <p>A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from nominating any more Labour
life Peers is to be made at a meeting of Labour M Ps tomorrow.
   <p>Mr. Michael Foot has put down a resolution on the subject and
he is to be backed by Mr. Will Griffiths, M P for Manchester
Exchange.
   <p>Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority
of Labour M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths
resolution.
<head><squote>ABOLISH LORDS</squote></head>
   <p>Mr. Foot's line will be that as Labour M Ps opposed the
Government Bill which brought life peers into existence, they should
not now put forward nominees.
   <p>He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that
Labour should not take any steps which would appear to <quote>prop up</quote> an
out-dated institution.
   <p>Since 1958, 13 Labour life Peers and Peeresses have been created.
   <p>Most Labour sentiment would still favour the abolition of the
House of Lords, but while it remains Labour has to have an adequate
number of members.
<head>AFRICANS DROP RIVALRY TO FIGHT SIR ROY</head>
<head>By DENNIS NEWSON</head>
   <p>THE two rival African Nationalist Parties of Northern Rhodesia
have agreed to get together to face the challenge from Sir Roy
Welensky, the Federal Premier.
   <p>Delegates from Mr. Kenneth Kaunda's United National
Independence Party (280,000 members) and Mr. Harry Nkumbula's
African National Congress (400,000) will meet in London today to
discuss a common course of action.
   <p>Sir Roy is violently opposed to Africans getting an elected
majority in Northern Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Iain
Macleod, is insisting on a policy of change.
   <p>Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on
the Protectorate's future.
   <p>Said Mr. Nkumbula last night: <quote>We want to discuss what to do
if the British Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall
through. There are bound to be demonstrations.</quote>
<head>All revealed</head>
   <p>Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield,
telephoned his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at
Chequers.
   <p>Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at Lancaster House
despite the crisis which had blown up. He has now revealed his full
plans to the Africans and Liberals attending.
   <p>These plans do not give the Africans the overall majority they
are seeking. African delegates are studying them today.
   <p>The conference will meet to discuss the function of a proposed
House of Chiefs.
<head>No secret talks &mdash; Macleod</head>
<head>By HUGH PILCHER</head>
   <p>MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary, denied in the
Commons last night that there have been secret negotiations on
Northern Rhodesia's future.
   <p>The Northern Rhodesia conference in London has been boycotted
by the two main settlers' parties &mdash; the United Federal Party and the
Dominion Party.
   <p>But representatives of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the
Central African Federation, went to Chequers at the week-end for talks
with Mr. Macmillan. Northern Rhodesia is a member of the
Federation.
   <p>Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end meeting. But he told M
Ps yesterday: <quote>I have no knowledge of secret negotiations.</quote>
   <p>He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal
Government. But the final decision remained with the British
Government.
   <p>Mr. James Callaghan, Labour's Colonial spokesman, said Sir
Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by refusing to sit
round the conference table.
   <p>Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties had refused to
attend the talks because Sir Roy had found messages sent from the
Government were <quote>unsatisfactory.</quote>
   <p>African delegates to the talks yesterday called on Mr.
Macmillan to cease his negotiations with Sir Roy's representative,
Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Chequers last week-end.
   <p>They said they regarded with <quote>growing anger</quote> the <quote>gross and
unconstitutional</quote> interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in
the talks. Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume today.
<head>DEEP SOUTH SMEARS JACK'S NEGRO</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT KENNEDY today defended the appointment of a Negro
as his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong opposition from the
anti-Negro senators of the Deep South.
   <p>The negro is Mr. Robert Weaver of New York. One of his tasks
will be to see there is no racial discrimination in Government and
State housing projects.
   <p>Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana, sparked off the opposition
by telling a television audience it was <quote>current Washington gossip</quote>
that Weaver once had Communist affiliations.
<head>A letter</head>
   <p>The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by another
Southern Senator &mdash; Willis Robertson, of Virginia &mdash; met today in closed
session to discuss Weaver's appointment.
   <p>Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter to Mr.
Kennedy saying he had received several complaints about Weaver's
loyalty.
   <p>He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's alleged association with
organisations black-listed by the Government.
   <p>Immediately Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reported on Mr.
Weaver.
   <p>He believed he would perform <quote>outstanding service</quote> in his
post.
   <p>Senator Robertson's committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's
nomination before it can be considered by the full Senate.
<head>Gold-hunting Kennedy shocks Dr. A</head>
<head>GERMANY MUST PAY</head>
<head>Offer of &pound;357m is too small</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough over West Germany's
cash offer to help America's balance of payments position.
   <p>He said bluntly in Washington yesterday that the offer &mdash;
&pound;357million &mdash; was not good enough. And he indicated that his
Government would try to get Germany to pay more.
   <p>He did not mention personal talks with Dr. Adenauer, the West
German Chancellor. But he said discussions <quote>on a higher level than
in the past</quote> might be useful.
   <p>The President will probably discuss the problem with Dr.
Brentano, the West German Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington
next week.
   <p>A big slice of Germany's <quote>aid</quote> is the early payment of a
&pound;210million debt to America. United States officials quickly point
out that this is money due to America anyway.
   <p>And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim that they cannot
pay more than &pound;357million without upsetting their own economy.
   <p>The Americans say Germany is having it too good and is not paying
for the past or for the present.
<head>Tough spot</head>
   <p>The Adenauer Government flatly rejected attempts by the
Eisenhower Government to get them to pay a regular sum towards the
cost of keeping American troops in Germany.
   <p>These support costs are a big drain on America's dollar reserves.
Dr. Adenauer's answer is the once-and-for-all cash offer of
&pound;357million.
   <p>President Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the West
German Government.
   <p>It will now have to pay more &mdash; and increase taxation to do so &mdash;
or run the obvious risks in upsetting the new American administration.
   <p>And, since this is election year in West Germany, Dr. Adenauer
is in a tough spot.
<head>Waiting</head>
   <p>Joyce Egginton cables: President Kennedy at his Washington
Press conference admitted he did not know whether America was lagging
behind Russia in missile power. He said he was waiting for his senior
military aides to come up with the answer on February 20.
   <p>This surprising statement was a sharp about-face from his
warnings during the Presidential election campaign. He claimed
slackness in the Eisenhower Administration had caused America to lag
behind Russia in nuclear development.
   <p>President Kennedy did his best to avoid giving Pressmen a direct
answer.
<head>HORRIFIED</head>
<head>That's a Tory doctor's reaction to the new health charges, says
George Brown</head>
<head><squote>PROBE THE DRUG PROFITS AND DON'T TAKE IT OUT OF MOTHERS AND
CHILDREN</squote></head>
<head>By HUGH PILCHER</head>
   <p>TWO men who are poles apart in personality last night dominated
Parliament's fiercest battle since the 1959 election &mdash; Mr. George
Brown and Mr. Enoch Powell, the Health Minister.
   <p>Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted, led Labour's attack
on the higher health charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly
unemotional, replied with a statistical statement &mdash; and ended by
inciting Labour M Ps to angry uproar.
   <p>One dealt with the human issue behind the Health Service; the
other tried to show that the balance-sheet must always come first.
   <p>The result of the vote was not in doubt. For the Tories were
massed in answer to their whips to defeat a censure motion on the
Government for <quote>undermining the Health Service</quote> and placing heavy
burdens on those least able to bear them.
   <p>Mr. Brown declared that the policy under censure was monstrous.
It had offended many people far beyond the ranks of Labour
supporters. The Press, many doctors and public were denouncing the
proposals.
<head>THE LETTER</head>
   <p>He quoted from this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received:
   <p><quote>My background is a doctor of 68, who has practised medicine
for 43 years, chiefly as a panel doctor.
   <p><quote>I am a lifelong Conservative. I am horrified and amazed by my
party's proposal to prostitute the whole principle of the State
service and to render that service a hardship to poor people.
   <p><quote>After a lifetime of helping others and healing the sick, my
considered opinion is that anybody supporting the increased charges is
a wicked, old &mdash;.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Brown went on: <quote>We are dealing with a noble edifice
which needs an imaginative architect to improve it, but it has got a
quantity surveyor. We have descended from the real problems to
fiddling about with bills of cost.
   <p><quote>We believe that a comprehensive medical service, free to the
patient at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
people, is good and attainable.
<QUOTE/>
<head>DIFFERENT</head>
   <p><quote>We remain for it. But the Tories never were.</quote>
   <p>Interrupted by angry Tories, Mr. Brown retorted: <quote>The
jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do.</quote>
   <p>He told them that their conception of social services was wholly
different &mdash; fundamentally different from that of Labour.
   <p>They would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
wretched &mdash; but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to get.
   <p>Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a ceiling on
health spending and started charges, Mr. Brown reminded the hostile
Government benches that was done in 1950 because of the financial
strain of the Korean war.
   <p>In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and needy than
Labour had to make it in 1950. And as a percentage of social service
expenditure, health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
   <p>Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the unsmiling Mr.
Powell.
   <p>He demanded that instead of taking it out of the patients Mr.
Powell should take ruthless action against the drug making industry,
whose profits had risen by up to 400 per cent. in the last eight
years.
   <p><quote>Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers,
children and sick people than to take on this vast industry,</quote> Mr.
Brown commented icily.
   <p><quote>Let us have a full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the
pharmaceutical industry.</quote>
   <p>The health of children today owed much to the welfare food
scheme. It was maintained during the war. Now in conditions of Tory
affluence it seemed it could not be carried on.
   <p>When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for a full
minute &mdash; and even his bitterest opponents on defence joined in.
<head>THE CHOICE</head>
   <p>Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving details of plans
for improving the hospital service, on which indeed the Government is
making progress.
   <p>His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that <quote>even
after the proposed changes the net cost of the service to the
Exchequer will have increased over three years by 20 per cent.
   <p><quote>That cannot continue without either development being limited
or an adjustment being made in financing.</quote>
   <p>The Government decided to adjust the financing &mdash; which Mr.
Powell claimed was underpinning &mdash; not undermining &mdash; the service.
   <p>Answering the attack on <quote>economic charges</quote> for welfare foods,
Mr. Powell said that all these foods would still be free in families
receiving regular National Assistance grants.
   <p>Of the doubled prescription charge his argument was: <quote>It is
ludicrous exaggeration to say that by and large a 2s. charge is any
more of a burden than a 1s. charge was in 1949.</quote>
<head><squote>RESIGN</squote></head>
   <p>Uproar from the Labour side grew as Mr. Powell made more and
more claims with which M Ps disagreed.

<head>MAC PICKS HIS MARKET TEAM</head>
<head>Our man in Paris is No 1 aide to Heath</head>
<head>By JOHN DICKIE</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN has picked a strong <quote>brains trust</quote> team to
negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
   <p>And he has abandoned plans to visit President \de Gaulle this
month to smooth the way.
   <p>General \de Gaulle's official welcome last week to Britain's
moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
but no more than that. So the idea of a personal mission by the Prime
Minister to Paris was dropped.
   <p>Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the
leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain's Ambassador to France, to
back Mr. Edward Heath, Lord Privy Seal, who is charged with the
conduct of negotiations with the Six.
<head>In touch</head>
   <p>At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth
Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests.
   <p>Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys, Commonwealth
Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept in touch in London.
   <p>Three of them &mdash; Canada, Australia, and New Zealand &mdash; will have
strong delegations at an opening meeting in London on Monday.
   <p>Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the
procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth
countries can arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating
team.
   <p>The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several
fields.
   <p>Sir Pierson Dixon has a wide reputation as a skilful
backstage negotiator since his days as Britain's chief UN
delegate.
<head>The team</head>
   <p>Second in command is Mr. Eric Roll, 53-year-old Deputy
Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries.
   <p>The Foreign Office is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay,
who has taken part in all the detailed Common Market exchanges over
the past year with the French, Germans, and Italians.
   <p>Other leading members are: Sir Henry Lintott from the
Commonwealth Relations Office, Sir William Corell-Barnes (Colonial
Office), Mr. G. R. Bell (Treasury), and Mr. G. H.
Andrew (Board of Trade).
   <p>They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when he goes to
Brussels, headquarters of the Common Market Commission, or wherever
the Six decide negotiations should be held.
   <p>Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a meeting in
Paris between M. Couve \de Murville, French Foreign Minister, and
Mr. Heath.
<head>Selwyn in strikeland</head>
<head>From WILLIAM FORREST ACCRA, Monday</head>
   <p>MR. Selwyn Lloyd &mdash; a man with troubles enough back home &mdash;
seems fated to fly into trouble abroad.
   <p>Last year it was the riots in Istanbul, which enlivened the
NATO Council meeting.
   <p>Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in Ghana coinciding
with the meeting of the Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council &mdash;
the first to be held in Africa.
   <p>Only a few hours after Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation
landed at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants demonstrated
outside the British-owned Kingsway Stores, the largest in town.
   <p>The stores had been hit by the same strike wave that has
paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past week.
   <p>Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget, including a
compulsory savings scheme which the Ghana Government introduced in
July.
   <p>Ghana's strong man is not here to face the storm. President
Nkrumah, having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference in
Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black Sea and no one here
professes to know when he will return.
   <p>But in his absence his chief lieutenants have not let him down.
The strong arm of authority has been raised against the strikers and
is now beginning to tell.
   <p>Today's Ghanaian Times (motto: ~<quote>The welfare of the people
is the supreme law</quote>) reports: <quote>The Government has been urged to
take immediate action to deal ruthlessly with the strikers.</quote>
   <p>The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's
Convention Party <quote>after powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei,
Tawia Adamafio,</quote> and others.
<head>Ultimatum</head>
   <p>Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi a <quote>limited
state of emergency</quote> was declared, giving the Government adequate
power to maintain all essential services and ensure food supplies.
   <p>Thus it becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment for
anyone who <quote>publishes a report likely to cause alarm or prejudicial
to public safety.</quote>
   <p>And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed on anyone
convicted of sabotage.
   <p>These stern measures had the desired effect today at Kumasi where
the strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre, they
are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 police and 16
armoured cars.
   <p>And how did the Government react when the strikers demonstrated
in Accra?
   <p>At 9.40 Mr. Edusei, Minister of Transport and probably the
toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team, drove up to the Kingsway Stores
and faced the demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
   <p><quote>If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock,</quote> he told them,
<squote>the police will act.</squote> At five to ten a posse of police arrived
and in less than two minutes the crowd had gone.
   <p>If the threatened <quote>counter-revolution</quote> was not enough to bring
the President back from his travels it might have been thought that
the muster from the 13 States of the Commonwealth was an occasion
worthy of his presence.
   <p>After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this year the
Economic Consultative Council should meet in Accra.
   <p>It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity he held a
reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador Hotel.
<head>PHONE TAPS</head>
<head>Disarmers accuse the Cabinet</head>
   <p>POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are openly
intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-disarming Committee of
100, the Committee claimed yesterday.
   <p>It said pressure was being put on members and associates all
over the country.
   <p>It alleged:
   <p>Phones were being tapped and going out of action;
   <p>Police were visiting people <quote>on no pretext whatsoever,
except to pass the time of day</quote>;
   <p>Supporters had been warned &mdash; one that his connection with the
committee was going too far; another that anti-apartheid agitation was
all right, but support for the committee was not. A third man's house
was watched for four days by plain-clothes men.
   <p>Committee-member Mr. George Clark commented at a Press
conference: <quote>The most extraordinary things are happening.</quote>
   <p>Fifty committee members will appear at Bow-street today,
including Lord Russell, Lady Russell, Lord Boyd-Orr, the Rev.
Michael Scott, and Mr. Clark.
<head>A <squote>plant</squote></head>
   <p>They are required to show why they should not be bound over for
disturbing the peace and for inciting a breach of the peace. The
summonses say they are <quote>likely to persevere in such unlawful
conduct.</quote>
   <p>Lord Russell, 89, was putting his affairs in order, and packing a
case, at his Chelsea home yesterday. His secretary, American-born
Mr. Ralph Schoenman, said: <quote>He is not going to agree to be bound
over. That will probably mean jail and, though frail, he is very fit
and will take the rigours of prison in his stride. He hopes to be
allowed to do some writing.</quote>
   <p>Back at the Press conference, Mr. Clark said two committee
members tried a <quote>plant</quote> call on a suspect phone. They discussed a
sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. &mdash; none was planned but police
turned up.
<head>Sir Roy attacks Kaunda's <squote>vicious monster</squote></head>
<head>From HARVEY WARD Salisbury, Monday</head>
   <p>SIR Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the
good faith of Mr. Kenneth Kaunda.
   <p>Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister, said that Mr.
Kaunda's United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious
as the Zambia National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda until
he was outlawed in 1959.
   <p>The record of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
back a long way, Sir Roy told the Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
   <p>He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters had
been arrested or convicted since last year on charges of creating
disturbances.
<head>Convicted</head>
   <p>During the first three weeks of the present trouble 287
incidents had been reported in Northern Rhodesia.
   <p>More than 500 people &mdash; 167 of them members of the UNIP &mdash;
were convicted last month in the Northern Province alone.
   <p><quote>Against this background must be taken Mr. Kaunda's repeated
statements that all he is doing is in the name of non-violence,</quote>
said Sir Roy.
   <p><quote>I am now compelled to say that I don't accept his good
faith.</quote>
   <p>He said Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements had stimulated
violence, but he had done nothing to stop it.
   <p><quote>It is true he made a point of again being absent from Northern
Rhodesia when his followers have indulged in such violence.</quote>
   <p>But Sir Roy pointed out that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said
that if UNIP did not get its way what would happen would make
the Mau Mau in Kenya <quote>seem like a child's picnic.</quote>
   <p>JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top priority to the
clash over Northern Rhodesia on his return from Scotland yesterday.
   <p>He summoned Mr. Iain Macleod, Colonial Secretary, and Mr.
Duncan Sandys, Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks at
Admiralty House.
   <p>A statement is expected today to hold the door open for
modifications to the new Constitution provided law and order is
maintained in Northern Rhodesia.
   <p>Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting problem.
   <p>Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a strong reaction from Sir
Roy Welensky to any suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to
the African nationalists.
   <p>Mr. Macleod has ample evidence from talks with Sir John Moffat,
Northern Rhodesian Liberal leader, and Mr. Kaunda, that the bulk of
moderates and Africans will reject the Constitution unless it is
modified.
<head>IN AFRICA A CLASH: IN LONDON A WELCOME</head>
   <p>A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of Buganda (King Freddie)
from Princess Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro, kneeling at the foot of his
airliner's steps at London Airport yesterday. Forty other Africans
greeted him, kneeling with heads bowed.
   <p>The princess, aged 24, is now studying history at Cambridge,
where she is a friend of Prince William of Gloucester.
   <p>King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms
in Uganda arrived for talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain
Macleod, before the Uganda Constitutional conference opens next
Monday. The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
   <p>The thorniest problem for next week's conference is to settle the
relationships between them and the rest of the country. A Government
report has recognised their rights and recommended a form of federal
association, but the four kings are not committing themselves and not
attending the actual conference, although Buganda politicians have
agreed to do so at the last minute.
   <p>Instead, the kings will remain in London and wait to hear the
conference's proposals. Then their views will be transmitted back.
<head>Russell jailed but ban-the-bomb fight goes on</head>
<head>RAB CRACKS DOWN</head>
<head>750 extra police will bar Sunday squatters</head>
<head>By Daily Mail Reporter</head>
   <p>MR. BUTLER, the Home Secretary, has decided to meet head-on
the biggest challenge to Government authority yet presented by the
<quote>Ban-the-Bomb</quote> demonstrators.
   <p>Police leave has been cancelled and secret plans prepared to
deal with the mass sit-down rally planned for Sunday in
Parliament-square by the Committee of 100, the anti-nuclear arms
group.
   <p>It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which ended yesterday
in 32 members of the Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting a
breach of the peace.
   <p>The committee's president 89-year-old Earl Russell and his
61-year-old wife were each jailed for a week.
   <p>Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen) and Robert Bolt
(The Flowering Cherry) were jailed for a month.
<head>Measures</head>
   <p>The possibility that the Government might invoke the Public
Order Act, 1936, and declare the whole rally illegal &mdash; whether the
demonstrators sit down or not &mdash; was being discussed in Whitehall last
night.
   <p>It was last used a year ago, to deal with the St. Pancras rent
riots.
   <p>Today Mr. Butler will have talks with Police Commissioner Sir
Joseph Simpson to draw up final plans for the <quote>Battle of Parliament
Square.</quote> Measures agreed so far include:
   <p>1. A mass call-out of police, special constables and reserves,
with 750 policemen posted from outlying districts to stations in the
area &mdash; West End Central, Bow-street, and Cannon-row.

<head>MR. TOURE IN ZAGREB</head>
<head>PRES. TITO'S POLICY FOR NEUTRALISM</head>
<head>FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>VIENNA, Jan. 9</head>
   <p>President Tito and Mr. S&eacute;kou Tour&eacute; arrived today in
Zagreb, where crowds of people welcomed the Yugoslav leader's guest,
who is celebrating his thirty-ninth birthday there.
   <p>The state visit of the President of Guinea is evidently regarded
by the Yugoslav leader as an emphasis on Yugoslavia's affinity with
Asian and African countries and, moreover, an opportunity to underline
his support for anti-colonial movements. Coming as it did, soon after
the conference at Casablanca, the Yugoslav press has written much on
the significance of the meeting of leaders of Africa, placing
particular stress on the urgency to settle the Congolese and Algerian
problems and condemning the <quote>intervention of colonial and
neo-colonial</quote> Powers.
   <p>Mr. S&eacute;kou Tour&eacute;'s stay in Yugoslavia is one in the series
of forthcoming visits of neutralist leaders from those continents, and
President Tito has already indicated that soon he is to travel to some
of those countries. Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of
Indonesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav Foreign
Minister.
<head>CONFERENCE FAVOURED</head>
   <p>In fact such Yugoslav activity has been particularly
intensified in the past year or so and though so far, apart from joint
action in the United Nations, these exchanges have not been seen on
any wider basis, President Tito is known for some time to have
favoured a conference of neutralist leaders.
   <p>The wish was particularly apparent in comments on the occasion of
the conference in Casablanca and, in particular, in Yugoslav approval
of the idea of an inter-African consultative assembly which would
coordinate activity on the political and economic sphere; and it is
not difficult to see that President Tito would like some such idea
extended also to the whole uncommitted world.
   <p>But he now feels, in view of a changed international situation
and especially in view of fresh problems facing the new and
independent countries of Africa, that the time is ripe to have more
frequent consultations between the uncommitted countries and even to
work out common stands on various problems facing those nations.
   <p>Two subjects, the Congo and Algeria, are the main topics of the
talks in Belgrade &mdash; and on both the two leaders have identical ideas.
<head>LAOS INVITATION TO PRINCE SOUVANNA</head>
<head>REQUEST TO RETURN</head>
<head>FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>SAIGON, Jan. 9</head>
   <p>Two emissaries from the Laotian Government of Prince Boun Oum
have arrived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince Souvanna
Phouma, the former Prime Minister, to return to Laos. No details of
their mission have been disclosed, but it was reported earlier in Laos
that Prince Boun Oum was considering asking Prince Souvanna Phouma to
join his Government.
   <p>Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to the mission, but
recent statements made by him in Phnom Penh indicate that he still
regards himself as the only legal Prime Minister of Laos.
   <p>His policy of strict neutrality from 1951 to 1958 kept the
kingdom in peace, though at the cost of virtual partition of the
country into the pro-communist north and the pro-western centre and
south.
<head><quote>LEGAL GOVERNMENT</quote></head>
   <p>Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information, Mr. Quinim
Pholsena, who claims to be his representative in Laos, yesterday
addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the
province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Souvanna's
Government was the only legal one in the country.
   <p>Prince Souphannouvong, leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat
Party, also spoke to the officers in the same terms. This emphasis on
the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well
with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists.
Most of the province of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain
of Jars, however, appear still to be firmly in their hands.
   <p>The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng, the
pro-communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane, but this
claim had been made before the end of last month. A correspondent who
travelled yesterday to within a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by
officers that this village was still held by the pro-communists.
<head>NEW IMAGE OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER FOR CANADIANS</head>
<head>From Our Own Correspondent</head>
<head>OTTAWA</head>
   <p>With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and his
Cabinet out in the grass roots making 160 speeches in 80
constituencies in 10 days, the Liberal Party are holding a national
conference here with some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since
1958 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader.
   <p>In some ways it will be a testing occasion for him, although some
think his position unassailable simply because there is no one else in
sight to supplant him. So the conference will concentrate on laying
the foundations on which to win the next election.
<head>CONSERVATIVE STOCK LOW</head>
   <p>The rally comes at a time when in spite of carefully worded
statements by the Prime Minister there is an air of electoral
expectancy. Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on a new
Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks which outlines in
some detail the accomplishments of the party since it came to office
three and a half years ago. Nevertheless there is little illusion in
the Conservative Party that their stock at home has fallen in the face
of heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.
   <p>Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative provincial
governments, Quebec and New Brunswick, and in the four federal
by-elections last October the party fared badly. They are now faced
with four other by-elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British
Columbia, one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the Maritimes &mdash;
Restigouche Madawaska, New Brunswick, and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
All four were Conservative strongholds.
   <p>Last September a public poll showed that for the first time since
the Administration came to power in 1957 the Liberals were ahead (43
per cent were in favour of <quote>The Grits</quote> if a federal election had
been held last autumn, 38 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 per
cent for the C.C.F.). However, a separate poll revealed that
Mr. Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of popularity as an
individual leader (for Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent, for Mr.
Pearson 34 per cent).
   <p>How far is Mr. Lester Pearson acceptable to the people of
Canada as a Prime Minister? Many observers at the national rally will
be seeking an answer. It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
in the role of a popular orator at the hustings, the spellbinder that
Mr. Diefenbaker was in the last two campaigns. The impression
remains that the Liberal leader is still the diplomatist, more at home
in the chancery, or the corridors of the United Nations, not the
father figure, so necessary in Canadian leadership, or the practical
politician, able to talk about sewage problems in Algoma East. On the
other hand, Mr. Pearson excels in meeting people informally, but
many still regard him <quote>as some sort of cross between an egghead and a
missionary</quote>.
<head>BOW TIE GONE</head>
   <p>His party advisers are now trying to correct that image. The
bow tie has gone; he is having lessons on television techniques and is
being coached by speech experts. Everything is being done to promote
a new image. Certainly, he is now a much tougher character
politically than when he took over the leadership. He was mercilessly
trounced by Mr. Diefenbaker in the House in those early days. It
has been a hard road back but now, with plenty of political ammunition
given him by the Government in recent sessions, he is leading the
Opposition with skill and assurance and is a match for the Prime
Minister across the floor.
   <p>Mr. Pearson is now talking about <quote>his new and dynamic
liberalism</quote> and this week will show perhaps how far <quote>Mike</quote> will
go. The main topic under review is unemployment, but there will be 21
committees examining subjects ranging from foreign investment in
Canada to the problems of the Atlantic provinces.
   <p>However, be this election year or not, Mr. Pearson, with his
party increasingly confident of return to power, must convey to the
nation that he has the stamp of a Prime Minister of Canada.
<head>BONN DOUBTS ON EUROPEAN SPACE PROJECT</head>
<head>MR. THORNEYCROFT'S TASK TO REMOVE SCEPTICISM</head>
<head>From Our Own Correspondent</head>
<head>BONN, Jan. 9</head>
   <p>Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in Bonn
tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a European space
satellite project, will find the Germans interested in the principle
of space research, but rather sceptical about British plans for
organizing it. Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that
this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to salve Blue
Streak, which was abandoned last summer as a military project; or that
the new European space satellite is indeed to be purely scientific in
character.
   <p>Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to remove these doubts,
and to persuade the Federal Government that the financial burden
involved is really worth while, at a time when any increase in
budgetary commitments would almost certainly involve a corresponding
rise in taxation &mdash; something no one is prepared to contemplate in an
election year.
<head>DUPLICATED EFFORT</head>
   <p>The cost of the European satellite project is estimated to be
at least &pound;60m. spread over five years. A Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today that west Germany, mainly for budgetary reasons,
had not signed a resolution adopted at an international conference in
Geneva last December, which called for the drawing up of a European
convention on a space satellite project.
   <p>But, at the same time, there is reason to believe that the
Federal Government is not convinced, on the basis of the information
it has so far, that such a project would be justified from a
scientific point of view; and not merely constitute a <quote>prestige</quote>
satellite, duplicating to some extent American efforts, as Die
Welt suggests today in a highly critical editorial article.
   <p>On the specific question of the use of Blue Streak, Mr.
Thorneycroft's task will be easier. He can point out that this is the
only rocket and launcher in Europe to have reached a sufficient stage
of development for adaptation as the first stage in putting a heavy
satellite into outer space. There has also been some talk of adopting
another British rocket, Black Knight, for the second stage, but the
French have one of their own called Veronique which they would like to
see used.
<head>MISSILE FEARS</head>
   <p>Perhaps one of the main reasons for German misgivings is the
fear that the French may not be especially interested in scientific
research as such, but more anxious to develop something which could
carry an atomic warhead of their own manufacture. The Federal
Government has made it clear that it would have no part in any project
for the development of long-range missiles &mdash; which in any case would
contravene the provisions of the Brussels treaty. The Foreign
Ministry spokesman added today, however, that the Brussels Treaty was
irrelevant, because research on the various rocket stages had already
been concluded, and only cooperation on the type of capsule was
involved.
   <p>A lesser obstacle to German participation is the absence of any
Ministry or Minister directly responsible for it &mdash; and therefore of
any budget under which funds could be appropriated.
   <p>Meanwhile, Professor Eugen Sa"nger, chairman of the German
Society for Rocket and Space Travel, has arrived in London as a
representative of the Federal Government, together with experts from
other countries, to study Blue Streak. He will be taking part in an
international conference on the space project which will meet on
January 30 in London.
<head>OTHER VENTURES</head>
   <p>During his two-day stay in Bonn, Mr. Thorneycroft will also
have talks with Herr Strauss, the Minister of Defence, Professor
Erhard, the Minister of Economics, Herr \von Brentano, the Foreign
Minister, and Dr. Seebohm, the Transport Minister. He will discuss
various plans for joint research and development of military items,
and in particular, it is understood, a vertical take-off fighter
aircraft. This is expected eventually to replace the Fiat G-91, and
the F 104 Starfighter, the backbone of the German Air Force.

<head>MAC GIVEN HIS ORDERS</head>
<head>Must join Common Market, says Kennedy</head>
<head>Daily Worker Reporters</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure on Mr. Harold
Macmillan to join the Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
House, Whitehall, yesterday.
   <p>Much of their three hours, 20 minutes of discussion is believed
to have been devoted to this main point of American policy.
   <p>It arose during talks following President Kennedy's report to the
British Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent visit to Paris.
   <p>There General \de Gaulle had made clear that he would accept
Britain into the Common Market only if there were no conditions laid
down to meet the Commonwealth and other reservations.
   <p>Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still wanted him to
apply for membership of the Common Market, even if it meant an
unconditional surrender.
<head>LAOS, BERLIN</head>
   <p>There were also brief discussions on Laos, Berlin and other
foreign questions, after Mr. Kennedy had informed Mr. Macmillan of
his discussions with Mr. Krushchov.
   <p>With the exception of 40 minutes when Lord Home, Foreign
Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge Bundy, the President's special assistant
for security affairs, were brought in, the two men talked alone.
   <p>An attempt to get more information about the Admiralty House
meeting will be made in the House of Commons this afternoon. Labour
M.P.s already have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
for a statement.
   <p>President Kennedy flew from London Airport last night to arrive
in Washington this morning. He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
broadcast and television report on his talks with Mr. Krushchov this
evening.
<head>COMMUNIQUE</head>
   <p>The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
third talks &mdash; the first were at Key West, Florida, the second in
Washington &mdash; said:
   <p><quote>Their discussions covered the major problems, both economic and
political, and revealed once again the close agreement of the two
Governments in pursuing their common purposes.
   <p><quote>Occasion was given to review the need for economic co-operation
and expansion in the general interests of developed and underdeveloped
countries alike.</quote>
   <p>It said that the President and Premier noted <quote>with
satisfaction</quote> the agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective
Laos ceasefire, which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement
at the Geneva conference.
   <p><quote>Particular attention was also given to the nuclear tests
conference and to the question of disarmament.
   <p><quote>The situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was
full agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin.</quote>
   <p>Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other guests
present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more times
yesterday.
<head>PESSIMISTIC</head>
   <p>In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of State,
gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 15-nation Nato
council. Some of his listeners said he was <quote>rather pessimistic</quote>
and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
   <p>From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President \de
Gaulle and informed him of the Vienna outcome. Last night Mr. Rusk
arrived in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
fly home with the President.
   <p>In DUESSELDORF, Chancellor Adenauer said the Vienna talks
<quote>might be the beginning of a slight improvement,</quote> but no big
changes should be expected in the political situation.
<head>MR K GETS HOME IN HIGH SPIRITS</head>
   <p>RELAXED, smiling and clearly in the best of spirits, Mr.
Krushchov yesterday returned to Moscow after his two days of talks
with President Kennedy, writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow.
   <p>The good beginning made at Vienna must be followed up by new
efforts for peace, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
declared yesterday.
   <p>Events in Vienna <quote>gave hope to people of goodwill who hate the
cold war, and to all who are striving for a stable peace,</quote> write the
paper's two correspondents from the Austrian capital.
<head>GOOD BEGINNING</head>
   <p><quote>Thinking over the results of the Vienna meeting, peace-loving
people will say <squote>a good beginning.</squote></quote>
   <p>Mr. Krushchov remained at the airport to join President
Brezhnev in welcoming Dr. Sukarno, President and Prime Minister of
Indonesia, who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a state visit 40 minutes
after Mr. Khrushchov had arrived from Vienna.
   <p>A cheering, delighted crowd of Indonesian students broke through
crash barriers to surround their President on the tarmac for several
minutes, chanting his name and waving flowers.
<head>FAREWELL SPEECH</head>
   <p>In VIENNA, before flying off to Moscow, Mr. Khrushchov
said he hoped his weekend talks with President Kennedy would help <quote>to
establish an enduring peace between nations.</quote>
   <p>Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President Schaerf,
the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for the hospitality and welcome he
had received.
   <p><quote>The Soviet Union has always striven and is striving to
safeguard an enduring peace for the peoples, to secure an early
solution of the disarmament problem, and to bring about a peaceful
settlement of international disputes through negotiations,</quote> he said.
<head>Gaitskell defends Polaris, Nato and himself</head>
<head>From GEORGE SINFIELD</head>
<head>HASTINGS, Monday</head>
   <p>MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded defence of
the Polaris missile base. And by implication he supported the
establishment of sites in Britain for the training of German troops.
   <p>His main theme was that nuclear weapons were necessary to defend
Britain, that Britain must depend on Nato and <quote>the West</quote> must have
nuclear weapons so long as the Soviet Union has them.
   <p>Addressing the annual congress of the National Union of General
and Municipal Workers, he said he felt sure the Labour movement was
coming round in support of his views.
   <p>Obviously conscious of the fierce and widespread resentment over
the U.S. Polaris base in Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he
even noticed that supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were
changing their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on to the
missile.
   <p>Mr. Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could not deny
facilities to nations to which it was allied. But governments should
be free to negotiate and refuse proposals with which they did not
agree.
<head>Outdated Thor</head>
   <p>The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because, he said, they
were out of date and vulnerable and would attract enemy action.
   <p>That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine. So long as
the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons, the West, somewhere, must have
them too.

   <p>It was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory purposes to
be under the sea rather than on land. This was why the Labour Party
did not think it right to oppose the Polaris depot ship.

   <p>The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base in the
Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a city with two million people.
It should be sited in a more remote area.
   <p>Mr. Gaitskell added that the Scarborough conference decisions
did not, in his view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority of
party members and still less the party's supporters in the country.
   <p>He was afraid lest the decisions would mean the labelling of the
party at a future General Election that it did not <quote>care about the
defence and security of our country.</quote>
   <p>After saying that Mr. Khrushchov believed Russian power to
retaliate had stopped a U.S. attack upon the Soviet Union, Mr.
Gaitskell said that what stopped the Russians in the last resort from
aggressive nuclear war was the certainty that they would be
annihilated.
   <p>Mr. Gaitskell added that agreement with the unilateralists was
not possible, though he respected their views.
   <p>He saw by reports that <quote>those who organise these things</quote> were
recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament to shift
the emphasis of their intervention away from straight opposition to
the official document on to opposition to the Polaris base.
<head>Nuclear spread</head>
   <p>To Mr. Macmillan, Mr. Gaitskell said the Prime Minister
should begin to take seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
weapons within the Nato alliance.
   <p><quote>Let us say to Macmillan that he should press, I hope with the
agreement of Kennedy, in talks with the Soviet Union, for the
establishment in central Europe of a zone of controlled
disarmament.</quote>
   <p>He thought, he said, that the Soviet Union would be prepared to
reach an agreement on a zone of controlled disarmament in Europe.
   <p>Mr. Gaitskell concluded, declaring that the present was the
beginning of a great period of opportunity for the party. It was a
great chance that should be grasped.
   <p>Inter-union jealousies prevent the fulfilment of a common policy
for wages and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper, president,
declared when congress opened.
<head>Gap widened</head>
   <p>He complained that the gap between earnings of manual workers
in local government, compared with the average in all industries for
men over 21, had widened over the past ten years from 34s to 73s a
week.
   <p>Mr. Cooper suggested that the distortion arose from enhanced
payments agreed at local level. Local negotiations and bargaining by
branch officers and shop stewards had come to stay and some way must
be found to integrate and co-ordinate their activities in official
negotiating machinery.
   <p>The General Council of the Trades Union Congress should therefore
consider the matter. Consideration should also be given to the
regrouping of unions and the modification of their structures to meet
the growing concentration of capital.
<head>Common benefits</head>
   <p>Mr. Cooper argued that a common industrial contribution was
urgent &mdash; particularly in unions serving workers in the same industry &mdash;
along with common benefits paid during strikes and lock-outs.
   <p>Suggesting that a total T.U.C. membership of eight million
was a <quote>poor show</quote> compared with some countries, he argued that the
position needed examination.
<head><squote>TAKE POLARIS AWAY</squote> LETTER</head>
<head>Russell plea to President</head>
<head>Daily Worker Reporter</head>
   <p>BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr. Macmillan yesterday
morning he was given the views of a wide section of the British people
about Polaris submarine bases in this country.
   <p>An open letter written by Earl Russell hoping that the
President's visit to London <quote>will prove fruitful</quote> was handed in at
the American Embassy by representatives of the Committee of 100.
   <p>Earl Russell, President of the Committee of 100, told Kennedy
that he should take notice of <quote>that very large and growing section
which is opposed to the establishment of a Polaris base, whether at
Holy Loch or elsewhere on British territory.</quote>
   <p>He pointed out that already there have been protests but that
<quote>very much larger protests are to be expected and are being
planned.</quote>
   <p>There are three kinds of reasons that justify the protests and
these should carry weight with the U.S. Government, Earl Russell
suggested.
   <p><quote>The first of these reasons is the importance of preserving the
hitherto cordial relations between the U.S. and Great Britain,
not only in Government circles, but in public opinion.</quote>
   <p>Earl Russell says it is inevitable, though profoundly
regrettable, that the agitation against the Polaris base has generated
some antagonism to the policy of the United States.
   <p>The second reason is concerned with doubts as to the safety of
the people of Great Britain; <quote>in a time of crisis it would probably
be impossible for the British authorities to exercise any degree of
control over the action of Polaris submarines.</quote>
<head>IN AN HOUR</head>
   <p>He argues that there is a distinct possibility that so long as
there is a Polaris base in Britain the Soviet Union might retaliate
against Britain alone.
   <p><quote>Such retaliation might, and probably would, destroy the whole
population of Britain in the course of, at the most, an hour</quote>
without provoking American retaliation.
   <p>Earl Russell believes: <quote>It is very questionable whether British
membership of Nato and British permission of American bases on our
territory add anything to the strength of America, while, on the
contrary, they impose upon America an onerous obligation which it may
prove impossible to fulfil.</quote>
   <p>The third reason is that the supreme interest for the whole
world &mdash; East and West and uncommitted nations &mdash; is the prevention of
nuclear war.
   <p><quote>A rapidly growing body of opinion in this country believes that
Britain could be more effective in preventing a nuclear war as a
neutral by helping to suggest agreements which could be accepted by
both East and West.</quote>

<head><quote>ONE FORCE</quote> AIM FOR SERVICES</head>
<head>Mr. Watkinson at work on five-year plan</head>
<head>400,000 REGULARS AND NO CALL-UP</head>
<head>By H. B. BOYNE,</head>
<head>Daily Telegraph Political Correspondent</head>
   <p>THE next White Paper on defence, to be published in March,
is likely to contain a five-year plan for the three Services. Its aim
will be to produce superbly equipped, all-Regular forces of about
400,000 men.
   <p>The three Services would be <quote>integrated</quote> to a greater extent
than ever before. Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not
contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force would become, for
practical purposes, a single defence force.
   <p>There would be complete co-operation at all levels in training
and operations. This would apply also in the command structure and
central administrative organisation.
   <p>Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the
plan for some months, with the Prime Minister's approval. He has had
numerous meetings with the Service Ministers.
   <p>He has also had talks with the Earl of Home, Foreign Secretary,
and with other Ministers concerned with overseas aspects of defence
policy.
<head>VOLUNTARY FORCES</head>
<head>Recruiting Confidence</head>
   <p>Details of the scheme are now being worked out by the Chiefs of
Staff, a process that may take four or five months. The scheme will
be subject to Cabinet approval.
   <p>Mr. Watkinson remains convinced that the policy initiated in
1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister of Defence, is still correct.
This was to return to the tradition of all-Regular voluntary forces,
with the last National Serviceman out of uniform by the end of 1962.
   <p>The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as
encouraging. He is confident the aim can be achieved.
   <p>While the possibility of an eventual return to National Service
in some form cannot be entirely discounted, he does not agree that the
point has been reached where this need even be considered.
<head>SERVICE CHIEFS</head>
<head>No Question of Dispute</head>
   <p>If National Service is ever resorted to, engagement would
probably have to be for three years. It is thought this would be the
minimum necessary for the extended training modern arms require and to
enable each man to serve at least a year overseas.
   <p>There is no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson is at odds
with the Service chiefs over the decision to dispense with National
Service, or over any other aspect of defence policy.
   <p>Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from
retired officers who have held high positions but are out of touch
with the existing situation.
   <p>Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support from the
C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, who believes
completely in the principle of an all-Regular army. Gen. Sir
Richard Hull, who is to succeed Sir Francis, is equally convinced
Mr. Watkinson is right.
<head>COMMAND CHANGE</head>
<head>Delay Due to Berlin</head>
   <p>Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard as from Nov. 1.
The hand-over, due in September, was delayed because of the Berlin
crisis.
   <p>Mr. Watkinson and his advisers felt the change would be unwise
at a moment when attention had to be concentrated on possible need for
important military operations.
   <p>For this reason Sir Francis stayed on, and sacrificed his leave.
Now that the Berlin situation seems more stable, it is felt he can
relinquish his duties.
   <p>As a field-marshal, he remains on the Active List. He may be
asked to take another important post.
<head>GAINS FOR Dr. VERWOERD'S PARTY</head>
<head>From COLIN REID,</head>
<head>Daily Telegraph Special Correspondent</head>
<head>CAPE TOWN, Thursday.</head>
   <p>AN electronic computer which has accurately forecast the
results of previous general elections put the new South African House
early this morning at 104 Nationalists and 52 United Party and
National Union members.
   <p>There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the
Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies
the disappearance of the Progressive party from the House.
   <p>Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalists
being returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the
Transvaal, with slightly increased majorities.
   <p>In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry
Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency,
Salt River, by the United party candidate, Mr. H. M. Timoney.
<head>DR. STEYTLER DEFEATED</head>
   <p>The defeat of the leader of the Progressive party, Dr.
Steytler, in Port Elizabeth South, announced immediately afterwards by
the United party candidate, Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives
deprived of both their chief figures.
   <p>Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of the Opposition, Sir \de Villiers
Graaff, have been returned unopposed. The contests were for 86 seats
as 70 Nationalists and 20 United party candidates are unopposed.
   <p>Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was evident that
voters were bored by the Government's frequent appeals to the
electorate.
   <p>The election was the fourth in four years. In most
constituencies it may go down as the most apathetic in the country's
history.
<head>MOBILISATION IF NECESSARY, SAYS PREMIER</head>
<head>FRESH CHECK ON FALL-OUT ORDERED</head>
   <p>THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that
he had considered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to
mobilise reserves necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on
to a war footing. He decided that it would be a great error to do so
and to recall Parliament.
   <p>But there would be no hesitation in mobilising if a further
deterioration in the situation warranted such a step. It would have
to be accompanied by other measures of a military, economic and
political kind.
   <p>Mr. Macmillan, who was winding up the foreign affairs debate,
said the Government could not be party to accepting as a matter of
principle the imposed division of Germany. <quote>We must not be rattled
into surrender, but we must not &mdash; and I am not &mdash; be  afraid
of negotiation.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Godber, Minister of State, Foreign Office, said earlier
that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess
the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests. The Council's
findings would be made public.
<head><quote>STAND FIRM</quote> CALL</head>
<head>Lord Avon's Maiden Speech</head>
   <p>With a vigour and authority which delighted old Parliamentary
friends and foes alike, the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony Eden,
in his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night, gave a warning
that appeasement over Berlin could only lead to war.
   <p>To stand firm, he declared, was not to invite war, but the surest
way to avert it. The free world could not yield to <quote>atomic
blackmail</quote> and survive.
<head>GETTING USED TO ANXIETY</head>
<head>PREMIER'S SPEECH</head>
<head>By T. F. LINDSAY</head>
<head>Daily Telegraph Special Correspondent</head>
<head>WESTMINSTER, Wednesday.</head>
   <p><quote>WE must get accustomed to anxiety,</quote> said the Prime
Minister to the House of Commons to-night, <quote>and not let ourselves
drift or be pushed into panic. We must not be rattled into surrender,
and we must not be, and I am not, afraid of negotiations.</quote>
   <p>It was the end of a rather curious speech in which Mr.
Macmillan wound up the two-day debate on foreign affairs. He began in
a low, almost chatty monotone, and his voice never rose to any accent
of urgency.
   <p>He passed in rapid review the United Nations Secretariat; nuclear
tests; the canard about British interference with the United Nations
in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East Asia.
   <p>He spent most of his short half-hour on Berlin. He deplored the
possibility of some <quote>new myth</quote> about betrayal of Germany by the
Allies.

   <p><quote>We do not,</quote> he said, <quote>really know what the Russians
want.</quote> But he was certain that they wanted to establish a final and
irrevocable division of Germany.
   <p>Britain could not be a party to an imposed division. But
negotiation, as the debate had shown, could be undertaken on a variety
of bases.
   <p>Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliberately refrained
during the summer from recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
by proclamation, such as would be necessary to bring the British Army
of the Rhine on to a fully active footing.
   <p>That would have created a thoroughly undesirable atmosphere of
panic. He thought that the situation was rather more hopeful.
   <p>The Russians now realised its seriousness. The French doubts
were more about procedure than about substance.
   <p>The Prime Minister's attitude of studied calm brought down the
temperature of the debate, which never at any time rose to fever
pitch, to a remarkable degree of sub-normality.
   <p>Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl of Home, Foreign
Secretary, was listening in the Peers' Gallery.
   <p>The early speakers in the debate each severely rated the speech
of his predecessor. These strictures were all too well justified.
   <p>We started with the plaintive wailings of Mr. Healey,
<quote>Shadow</quote> Foreign Secretary, described by Mr. Godber, Minister of
State, Foreign Office, as <quote>pedantic and obscure on Berlin, damaging
and obscure on the Congo.</quote>
   <p>In turn, Mr. Godber was censured by Mr. Shinwell, former
Labour Defence Minister, for having read the House an ill-prepared
essay.
<head>TOO WIDE A RANGE</head>
<head>Free-for-All</head>
   <p>The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely.
They remind one of the Rugby match in <quote>Tom Brown's Schooldays,</quote> in
which all the boys were welcome to take part, and only those who
<quote>really meant business</quote> removed their jackets.
   <p>Not many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of
to-night's debate. Mr. Healey had another tilt at the Prime
Minister's golf-course Press conference, which he described as <quote>a
display of flabby and fatuous complacency which takes us straight back
to Neville Chamberlain.</quote>
   <p>A reference to the reunification of Germany brought a bark of
~<quote>Start another war!</quote> from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on
Trent S.). Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet theme of
limitation of armaments in Europe.
   <p>This could, he suggested, be linked with prohibition of the
production of atomic weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection and
control would be much easier to establish in these territories.
   <p>Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards.
Ministers had rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the
new Russian tests, but they themselves had no condemnation for events
in Angola or Algeria.
   <p>It was not for the Government, said Mr. Healey, to take up
moral attitudes, <quote>especially when the temple of their religion is the
bingo-parlour.</quote> This puzzled such students of comparative religion
as had failed to detect this cult.
   <p>But Mr. Healey had a partial and limited success. He rallied
behind him the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last night by his
leader, Mr. Gaitskell.
<head>SCORN MERITED</head>
<head>Mr. Godber's Speech</head>
   <p>Mr. Godber's performance merited all the mild scorn heaped on
it by Mr. Shinwell. True, he did tell the House that the Government
had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out
position in view of the Russian tests, and said that the council's
findings would be published.
   <p>He was not so happy in his defence of the Government's failure to
condemn France for her nuclear tests in the Sahara on the grounds that
they were only little ones. This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
and her illegitimate baby.
   <p>For the most part, Mr. Godber muttered his way through a
cliche-ridden Foreign Office brief. He resembles the elephant seal,
an otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is limited, we are
told, to a series of heavy sighs.
<head>M.P.s PROTEST AT EMBASSY</head>
<head>RUSSIAN TESTS</head>
<head>By Our Political Staff</head>
   <p>Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas, M.P. for Leicester N.E., a
former Labour Solicitor-General, and Mrs. Barbara Castle, M.P.
for Blackburn, a member of the Labour party National Executive,
delivered a letter to Mr. Soldatov, the Russian Ambassador, last
night protesting against the Russian nuclear tests. It was signed by
60 Labour M.P.s, many of them Left-wing sympathisers.
   <p>It condemned <quote>the pollution of the world's atmosphere as a crime
against humanity.</quote>
   <p>A personal letter of protest against the tests from Canon
Collins, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, addressed
to Mr. Khruschev, was also taken to the Russian Embassy.
<head>Mass Lobbying</head>
   <p>A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes: Ban-the-bomb demonstrators
thronged the Central Lobby of the House of Commons last night and
formed a queue stretching for more than 200 yards outside in Old
Palace Yard. About 2,000 lobbied M.P.s and harangued them on
disarmament.

<head>Mac and Lloyd whisper...</head>
<head>EARLY CURB ON THE PROFIT SHARKS</head>
<head>By MICHAEL STEVENSON</head>
   <p>MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans to catch speculators
in shares and property.
   <p>The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to public opinion over
his <quote>July Budget</quote> came dramatically in the Commons yesterday.
   <p>Mr. Lloyd said on Tuesday that he proposed to deal in his next
regular Budget with some profits which now escape tax.
   <p>Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said
yesterday that the Government does not like retrospective legislation.
   <p>He went on to describe the kind of people the Chancellor hopes to
tax.
   <p>These are people buying and selling shares within a short period,
those <quote>stagging</quote> on a new issue and property dealers who form a
chain of companies and put one property deal through each.
   <p>Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to offer the
Government an easy passage for such legislation.
   <p><quote>Why don't you make proposals to legislate in the autumn?</quote>
Mr. Wilson asked.
   <p><quote>We wouldn't call it an Autumn Budget. You can call it a
Taxation Management Bill, if you like.</quote>
<head>Nodded</head>
   <p>While Mr. Wilson was speaking, the Prime Minister and Mr.
Lloyd had a whispered conversation.
   <p>They nodded at each other and Sir Edward rose to say that the
Chancellor would bear Mr. Wilson's offer in mind.
   <p>Guy Eden writes: Treasury experts are already working on the
scheme.
   <p>Profits of genuine investors in industry will not be affected,
but only quick in-and-out speculator deals.
<head>FOULKES REFUSES SUICIDE</head>
   <p>FRANK FOULKES, Communist president of the ETU, refused
yesterday to <quote>commit suicide</quote> at the TUC's invitation.
   <p>He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to
the ETU.
   <p>In reply to the call for his resignation he said:
   <p><quote>Our rules say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to
run again for three years.
   <p><quote>I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire, so this is an
invitation from my good friends of the TUC that I should commit
hara-kiri.
<QUOTE/>
<head>The terms</head>
   <p>The other TUC demands:
   <p>Five leading Communists must not hold office for five years;
   <p>Sub-committees set up to strip secretary John Byrne of his powers
must disband in ten days.
   <p>These the ETU executive rejected as <quote>wholly
unacceptable</quote> and <quote>unwarranted interference.</quote>
   <p>But it agreed to postpone operation of the sub-committees.
   <p>The union now lays itself open to suspension from the TUC
followed by expulsion. A TUC committee will decide next month at
a special meeting.
<head>UTOPIA 1980...</head>
<head>BUT Mr. K SHOWS HIS TEETH</head>
<head>WARLIKE FLOWS THE NEVA</head>
   <p>THE biggest naval show ever seen on the River Neva was staged
yesterday by Mr. Kruschev as Russia read his promises of a Communist
Utopia by 1980.
   <p>Among the 60 ships were rocket-carrying craft ranging in size
from torpedo-boats to cruisers, and submarines <quote>able to strike mighty
blows,</quote> according to a TV commentator.
   <p>The small rocket craft, for destroying big ships, are controlled
automatically, even to the preparations for launching their rockets.
<head>Red NATO</head>
   <p>Applauding on the river banks at Leningrad were thousands now
told that in 20 years they will have free food, housing, light, heat,
transport and medical treatment &mdash; all for a working week of 34 to 36
hours.
   <p><quote>The whole naval might of the Soviet Union can be seen here &mdash;
a truly inspiring and proud sight,</quote> said Moscow radio's commentator.
   <p>The parade was reviewed by Marshal Andrei Grechko, commanding the
forces of the Warsaw Pact countries &mdash; the Communist <quote>Nato.</quote>
   <p>He said rocket-carrying atomic submarines now formed the basis of
the Soviet Navy.
<head>As Mac reveals his momentous decision to join the Six</head>
<head>LONE TORY MP LASHES PREMIER</head>
<head>By MICHAEL STEVENSON</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN'S announcement in the Commons of his
momentous decision to apply for membership of the Common Market
provoked a violent personal attack by one &mdash; just one &mdash; of his
backbenchers.
   <p>Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision <quote>shocking</quote>
and added:
   <p><quote>It is the most disastrous thing any Prime Minister has done
for many, many generations.</quote>
<head>MPs SHOCKED</head>
   <p>He concluded: <quote>The best service the Prime Minister can do
would be to resign.</quote>
   <p>The outburst shocked MPs of all parties.
   <p>Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell to stop.
   <p>There were loud cries of <quote>shame</quote> from all parts of the
Conservative side.
   <p>Mr. Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat down.
   <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Fell got up and left the chamber.
   <p>He returned five minutes later to stand just inside the doorway
looking more composed.
   <p>In the middle of the amazing scene, Mr. Macmillan waved his
hand at Mr. Fell.
   <p>This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more.
   <p><quote>I cannot be told to sit down by the Prime Minister.</quote>
   <p>Protests had been expected from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's
attack was unprecedented.
   <p>He accused the Prime Minister of <quote>political double talk.</quote>
<head><squote>DISASTER</squote></head>
   <p><quote>It had the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks
this Prime Minister is a national disaster,</quote> he said.
   <p>Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if anything,
rallied support to the Prime Minister.
   <p>This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
   <p>He confined his reply to the observation that Mr. Fell had
probably <quote>maximised his support.</quote>
   <p>There were no other attacks of such ferocity.
   <p>But there was ample evidence of Conservative and Labour
opposition, which will be aired in the debate tomorrow and on
Thursday.
   <p>As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement, the House was
crowded.
   <p>He said: <quote>No British Government could join the European
Economic Community without prior negotiation with a view to meeting
the needs of the Commonwealth countries, of our European Free Trade
Association partners and of British agriculture.</quote>
<head><squote>IT'S RIGHT</squote></head>
   <p>Near the end of a long statement, Mr. Macmillan stated the
Government's intention:
   <p><quote>After long and earnest consideration, Her Majesty's Government
have come to the conclusion that it would be right for Britain to make
a formal application.. for negotiations with a view to joining the
Community.</quote>
   <p>At this point, Mr. Paul Williams (Cons., Sunderland) called
out <quote>Shame.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Williams is a close associate of Mr. Fell.
   <p>Mr. Macmillan said, if negotiations were brought to a
conclusion, there would be consultation with Commonwealth countries
before the matter was put to the Commons.
<head>MAC SEES EUROPE A COMMONWEALTH</head>
<head>By MICHAEL STEVENSON</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN yesterday looked forward to a Commonwealth &mdash;
of Europe.
   <p>This was his vision of the Western Europe which he hopes
Britain can join through the Common Market.
   <p>But Mr. Macmillan rejected a suggestion that Britain would
lose its identity in some future political merger.
   <p><quote>The concept of a federal system, like the United States, was
unreal,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>Europe is too old, too diverse in tradition, language and
institutions, for that.</quote>
<head>In tune</head>
   <p>But a Commonwealth of Europe was much more in tune with their
national traditions and ours.
   <p>The Premier was opening a two-day debate in the Commons on the
Common Market.
   <p>He claimed that, unless we were in the Common Market, we should
not be able to play any part in determining its future.
   <p><quote>We can lead better from within,</quote> he said.
   <p>Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection raised by Tory
critics.
   <p>Mr. Anthony Fell, who created a scene on this point on Monday,
took up a position almost hidden behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair.
<head>Tribute</head>
   <p>Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help to the Commonwealth
through the strength we would gain in the Common Market than by
isolation.
   <p>He paid tribute to the development of the Common Market.
   <p><quote>The Community (Common Market) has imparted an impetus and an
economic growth to The Six. Above all, it is an idea which has
gripped men's minds,</quote> he said.
   <p>Referring to previous negotiations, Mr. Macmillan looked
towards Mr. Reginald Maudling.
   <p><quote>These were negotiations in which the President of the Board of
Trade played a conspicuous part,</quote> the Premier said.
   <p>He dismissed the idea that Britain would be swamped by cheap
labour.
   <p>Our industry, he said, would probably gain.
   <p><quote>Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too much shelter,</quote> he
went on.
   <p><quote>We cannot draw up a precise balance-sheet for our industry.</quote>
   <p>But the balance of advantage probably lay in the size of markets
which would be available &mdash; something comparable to the United States
or Russia.
   <p>Mr. Hugh Gaitskell argued that no final decision should be
taken until a conference of Commonwealth Premiers had been held.
   <p>Conservatives protested when Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
told in Europe last weekend that we were looked upon as a liability.
   <p>He had been told this <quote>by some people of considerable
authority,</quote> he retorted.
   <p><quote>I agree with the Prime Minister that I do not think we are
necessarily bound for federalism in Europe,</quote> he went on.
<head>Tariffs</head>
   <p>If we joined the Common Market, our food subsidies would
probably be replaced by a system of tariffs.
   <p><quote>That will mean a rise in the cost of living.</quote>
<head>YES, IT'S A GOLD RUSH, SELWYN</head>
   <p>BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are spending more as the
summer holiday season moves into top gear.
   <p>On the eve of August Bank Holiday the spending spree is at a
new all-time peak.
   <p>Note circulation soared for the sixth successive week &mdash; this time
by more than &pound;15,000,000 last week.
   <p>And that brought the figure to a record &pound;2,415,000,000.
   <p>This was &pound;100,000,000 more than the corresponding week last
year and &pound;37,000,000 up on the 1960 record set last Christmas.
   <p>Now look at the other side of all these coins.
   <p>The big <quote>squeeze</quote> means that it is going to be more
difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft.
   <p>And banks will be stricter in recalling existing overdrafts.
   <p>This is underlined in the Central Bank's weekly return...
   <p>...which shows that more than &pound;163,000,000 of the banks' money is
now frozen in the form of special deposits with the Bank of England.
   <p>Banks have paid in a first instalment of almost &pound;8,000,000 in
response to the Budgette appeal.
   <p>About another &pound;70,000,000 is due by September 20. For nearly
a year about &pound;150,000,000 has been frozen.
<head>K CRIES I SPY NAZIS</head>
   <p>MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of German militarism in his
replies to the West on Berlin.
   <p>And he repeats that the problem <quote>must be solved this year.</quote>
   <p>The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to West Germany were
published in Moscow yesterday. They tell:
   <p>The U.S. &mdash; It is false to say the absence of a peace treaty
with Germany causes no real danger.
   <p>West Germany, with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is
becoming a hotbed of war danger in Europe.
<head>Barbarously bombed</head>
   <p>Even now, aided by the U.S., Britain and France, it has
more than enough forces and arms to touch off a world war.
   <p>BRITAIN &mdash; One cannot but wonder at British bases being put
at the disposal of those very militarists who razed Coventry and
barbarously bombed London and other British cities.
   <p>FRANCE &mdash; One can hardly conceive the French are not
alarmed....
   <p>Next door, in West Germany, before everyone's eyes there has
sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi generals and officers.
   <p>With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to
self-determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence.
   <p>WEST GERMANY &mdash; Russia would like to see a clear realization
that West Germany would not survive even a few hours of a third world
war.
   <p>The best way to rule out such a tragic contingency would be to
sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous growth of West Berlin's
occupation status.
   <p>Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-determination is the
intention to impose on East Germany the regime existing in West
Germany.
<head>THOUSANDS SCARED BY K TREK OUT</head>
   <p>REFUGEES are pouring out of East Germany into West Berlin
faster than ever.
   <p>Mr. K's latest speech scared 1,157 East Germans to cross into
West Berlin's reception centre DURING MONDAY NIGHT. And officials
expect the total to leap to 3,000 a day.
   <p>This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the East
German disturbances on July 17, 1953.
   <p>And officials fear it may be too much for the city's refugee
camps. They will overflow and private houses will have to be used.

<text id=LOBA07>
<head>FOLLOW WINTER AT SANDOWN</head>
<head>Team Spirit nap to repeat his Mildmay win</head>
<head>By THE SCOUT</head>
   <p>TEAM SPIRIT, winner of the Mildmay Memorial 'Chase last
January, returns to Sandown today in an attempt to stage a repeat.
   <p>Strictly on the book, he has little chance of beating Dandy
Scot &mdash; assuming that Fred Winter's mount would have made it a very
close thing 12 months ago had he not capsized at the last fence.
   <p>Team Spirit is 12lb. worse off this time, but on the other hand
is two years younger than his rival, and is likely to have made the
greater improvement.
   <p>Also, there is little doubt that he has a brighter turn of
finishing speed than Dandy Scot, who only held on to second place in
the Rhymney Breweries 'Chase through his own indomitable courage and
the relentless driving of his jockey.
<head>GOOD FORM</head>
   <p>Limonalt, brought down by Chavara when well to the fore at
Cheltenham last month, earlier beat Frenchman's Cove here &mdash; form that
looked all the better when the runner-up went on to trounce Mandarin
at Kempton.
   <p>Limonalt is nothing to look at but is tough and game, and will
stay this trip well.

   <p>He is suggested as the best each-way long-shot and, together with
Dandy Scot, the danger to Team Spirit (2.35 nap).

   <p>Even if he fails on Dandy Scot, Fred Winter is unquestionably the
jockey to follow. He should score on Flame Gun (1.30), Some Alibi
(3.5), and Tovaritch (3.30).
   <p>Blinkers made all the difference to Tovaritch at Hurst Park and,
similarly equipped today, he looks much too good for his Village
Hurdle rivals.
   <p>Best of the opposition may be Chinese Pintall, favourably noted
when sixth, running-on, behind Luminarch here last month.
   <p>Flame Gun, unbeaten here, seems well suited to giving away lumps
of weight in small fields such as he faces in the Londesborough
'Chase.
<head>CAPSIZED</head>
   <p>It is impossible to say whether Some Alibi would have won had
he not capsized three fences out at Windsor last Saturday.

   <p>But he was several lengths ahead of King's Nephew at the time,
and would have probably made a close race of it.

   <p>He should have too much speed, providing he stands up, for Hal's
Hope, still far from a clever fencer, in the Stand Novices' 'Chase.
   <p>Top novices' clash is at Birmingham, where Retour de Flamme
(2.0), Tokoroa, and Bandalore meet in the Packington 'Chase.
   <p>Retour de Flamme allies his always bright turn of speed to
brilliant fencing, and he should be too strong at the finish for his
rivals.
   <p>Commandeer (3.30) is one of the best four-year-old hurdlers seen
out so far &mdash; though that is not saying much. He should have an easy
task in the last event.
<head>RETOUR DE FLAMME FOR THE <squote>REPLAY</squote></head>
<head>By PETER O'SULLEVAN</head>
   <p>THE finishing order in the 1958 Champion Hurdle, won by
Bandalore from Tokoroa and Retour de Flamme (2.0 nap), may be
reversed in a unique replay this afternoon, when the trio clash at
Birmingham over fences.
   <p>Retour de Flamme was frequently backed to beat Tokoroa over
hurdles, but in six encounters he never succeeded.
   <p>And after each had staged an impressive first-time effort over
fences Fred Rimell bet Syd Warren that Tokoroa would again triumph the
first time they met in a 'chase.
   <p>The Packington 'Chase will determine the bet, and if Syd Warren
proves the winner, as I expect, Bob McCreery will complete an unusual
hat-trick.
   <p>For on the two previous occasions he partnered this novice
National entry, he won on him at Lewes (on the flat) and over hurdles
at Newton Abbot.
   <p>Anyway it should be a great race. For Tokoroa's Hurst Park
running was undoubtedly an incorrect reflection on his true ability.
While Bandalore had no chance last time out to endorse his notable
first fencing effort.
<head>THE BLOT?</head>
   <p>Northern Mildmay hope, Springbok arrived at Sandown yesterday
in fine trim after leaving Middleham at 5 a.m. He could prove a
blot on the handicap &mdash; as connections hope.
   <p>Merganser also seems well treated, and Johnny Lehane is confident
of a bold bid by Miss Popsi Wopsi.
   <p>Me, I am going along with Dandy Scot (2.30 e.w.) on his
seventh run over the course where his first effort in the 1955-6
season was a fall two from home in a novices' 'chase.
   <p>Since then he has won two 'chases here and been beaten a short
head over hurdles.
   <p>Gerry Madden's luck finally changed yesterday &mdash; and what a
reception his fellow jockeys gave him &mdash; when King's last-fence fall
handed the Stanley 'Chase to Mandarin.
   <p>There is now no doubt that the winner's confidence was shaken by
his Chepstow fall, and he'll miss the National in favour of a Gold Cup
preparation.
   <p>And, of course, 29-year-old Gerry, to whom Mme Kilian Hennessy
has remained so loyal, will continue to partner him henceforth.
   <p>Problem horse Mossreeba even defied Johnny Gilbert's skill in the
Metropolitan Hurdle.

   <p>He struck the front after jumping the last but as Keith Piggott
says: <quote>He'll come and beat anything,  but as soon as he gets his
head in front up it goes &mdash; and he doesn't want to know.</quote>

   <p>Avala compensated the stable when a doubtful issue was clinched
by Beldon Hall's last-fence fall in the Mole Handicap.
<head>League v Players &mdash; replay Wednesday</head>
<head>MINISTRY STAGE A LAST-CHANCE PEACE TALK</head>
<head>By CLIVE TOYE</head>
   <p>AN urgent peace move by the Ministry of Labour last night could
stop Soccer's headlong flight into a strike. The Ministry have called
the Football League and the players' leaders together for a conference
in London next Wednesday &mdash; 72 hours before the players' strike is due
to begin.
   <p>The conference could end in, at least, a postponement of the
strike notices. For the players' leaders are keen to tell the League:
<quote>We wish to negotiate on one of YOUR ideas &mdash; an eased form of
the retain and transfer system.</quote>
   <p>This new system was suggested by the Football League management
committee on December 29, accepted by the players, then rejected by
the Football League club chairmen this week, causing the present
crisis.
<head><squote>FIRST-CLASS IDEA</squote></head>
   <p>Players' leader Jimmy Hill said last night: <quote>It was an
absolutely first-class idea by the League, and it would really work in
practice.
   <p><quote>The League clubs feared this proposal because they thought it
could rob them of too many players at one time. That isn't so.
   <p><quote>With new, longer contracts, a manager could sign some of his
players for one year, some for two and some for three. At the end of
any one season, only a small number of players would be in a position
to ask for a move.</quote>
   <p>League president Joe Richards said last night at his Barnsley
home that he would go to next Wednesday's meeting <quote>if my presence
means avoiding a strike.</quote>
   <p>He added: <quote>But I am not going to waste time. I am not budging
on the issue of the transfer system.</quote>
   <p>The players now believe that, if it is necessary, the final
instrument for the defeat of the Football League is the case of
26-year-old former England B inside-forward Alfie Stokes.
<head>STRONG CASE</head>
   <p>Stokes is ready to take legal action against Fulham, his last
League club, claiming they have no right to keep him out of League
football.
   <p>Stokes, the players have been advised, has an even stronger case
against the League's present contract than George Eastham, the
Newcastle star transferred to Arsenal after a long, bitter wrangle
with Newcastle.
   <p>Under the system suggested by the League management on December
29, a player due to be offered a new contract by his club would be
given details of his terms by May 19, accepting or refusing by May 31.
If he refused to sign, the League would find him another club before
June 30.
   <p>If a player was not transferred by June 30, and his club wished
to retain him, the club would have to pay him a minimum of &pound;15 a week
until he was transferred.
<head>Mr. X will be happy with 10%</head>
<head>By ROBERT FINDLAY</head>
<head>The Sports Editor</head>
   <p>THE mysterious Mr. X sat drinking coffee in the back room
of his modest Charterhouse-street, London, office.
   <p>Mr. X, accused by Football League secretary Alan Hardaker as
being the man behind the strike. 
   <p>Mr. Hardaker hinted Mr. X wanted to enrol all footballers
under his banner, then hire them out to clubs at his price. Wasn't
Jimmy Hill, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, one
of his men?
   <p>I decided on a frontal attack. <quote>You are trying a Soccer
take-over,</quote> I accused the fresh-faced, fortyish character who
offered me coffee in an Irish brogue. <quote>You want to dictate to the
League clubs.</quote>

   <p>Mr. X sighed helplessly. <quote>Not on your life. I'm only a
literary agent trying to earn 10 per cent to keep the wolf from the
door.</quote>
   <p>Bagenal Harvey is the name. His partner sat opposite him. His
name? Denis Compton.
   <p>Eleven years ago the enterprising Mr. Harvey began to
specialise in contributions by well-known sportsmen. He enrolled them
on 10 per cent commission to endorse articles for newspapers,
periodicals, books, broadcasts, and advertising.
   <p>He guided the feet of Denis Compton, Godfrey Evans, John Surtees,
Danny Blanchflower, Johnny Haynes, Trevor Bailey, and dozens of other
sportsmen through the pitfalls of Fleet-street towards contracts based
on their fame and personality as sportsmen.
   <p><quote>And that's all I'm interested in,</quote> said Mr. Harvey
helplessly. <quote>Ten per cent and the right to help sportsmen make
something out of their great reputations.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Harvey is extremely successful in his aims, though he
creates enemies in sport and in Fleet-street through his activities in
putting a price on sportsmen's contributions.
   <p><quote>But to say I am behind the strike is so much nonsense,</quote>
declared Mr. Harvey heatedly. <quote>WHY? I can't make players'
contracts. I can't make a club pay a player so much a week. And,
what's more, I don't want to.
   <p><quote>A strike's the last thing I want. It would put my clients out
of business, and then where would I be?
   <p><quote>Mr. Hardaker knows Jimmy Hill is on my list of contributors,

   <p><quote>Jimmy has legal and other advisers much better qualified to

   <p><quote>And in any case I have enough to do minding my own business
without wasting time dispelling silly rumours.</quote>
   <p>On the walls of his office hung pictures of sporting celebrities
signed in <quote>many thanks</quote> terms. On his shelves stood sporting books
by his contributors.
   <p>Denis Compton broke in with: <quote>And, believe it or not, Bagenal
is the only man an England cricket team ever invited to go on tour at
their expense.
   <p><quote>It was before the 1957-58 tour of South Africa, when Bagenal
said half-jokingly before some of the team: <squote>I wish I was going with
you so-and-so's.</squote>
   <p><quote>The next thing the M.C.C. lads had whipped round the
necessary &pound;500 and invited Bagenal, through their captain, Freddie
Brown, to go with them.
   <p><quote>He didn't because he took ill shortly afterwards, but the
gesture was what I call <squote>highly commended</squote> in any language.</quote>
   <p>I said adieu and left Mr. X stripped of his mystery, to finish
his coffee and calculate the week's takings at 10 per cent.
<head>CHEUNG from CHINA FACES WOLVES</head>
<head>By MIKE LANGLEY</head>
   <p>OUT with the half-time lemon and in with the chop-suey... for
here comes Cheung Chi Doy, the first full Chinese to play in the
Football League. He is Blackpool's outside left against Wolves today.
And Aston Villa assistant manager Dick Taylor, who saw 19-year-old
Cheung bamboozle Villa reserves on New Year's Eve, offers this
testimonial: &mdash;
   <p><quote>I've not seen such a perfectly balanced player for years. I
just can't understand why he hasn't been in the first team sooner.</quote>
   <p>Cheung called in at Blackpool last summer on his way to Rome,
where he was due to play for Formosa in the Olympics. He decided he
liked Lancashire, forgot Rome, and signed professional for Blackpool
in October.
   <p>Ten reserve games, the last five at centre forward, and seven
goals &mdash; that's Cheung's record.

<head>NEWPORT NEARLY STICK IN THE MUD</head>
<head>Oxford Fail to Combine: Willcox Outstanding at Full-back</head>
<head>By RUPERT CHERRY</head>
<head>Newport... 14pts</head>
<head>Oxford University... 5</head>
   <p>THIS was harder work for Newport than the score suggests.
Come rain, slime or mud &mdash; and all were present at Rodney Parade &mdash;
Newport always try to retain their famous and spectacular technique of
handling and backing-up. This time, however, it almost came unstuck,
or rather stuck in the mud.
   <p>True they scored two tries, but one was almost a gift. Their
second penalty goal was in the same category, so that the margin of a
goal, two penalty goals and a try to a goal was, on the whole,
somewhat flattering.
   <p>Oxford put up a splendid fight and none more so than their
courageous captain, Willcox. His fielding, tackling and covering were
a complete justification of his selection for England against Ireland.
   <p>Oxford had their share in the open but, unlike Newport, could not
combine as a team. So their movements were short as well as few and
far between.
   <p>The centres, after one or two tentative thrusts early on when the
ground was not cut up, soon found they were reduced to kicking. This
they did all too often straight to the opposition.
   <p>In the circumstances, Brown, in place of Sharp at fly-half, was
probably justified in preferring to kick rather than to set his line
going over ground in which the lightest step made a deep imprint.
<head>EARLY RHYTHM</head>
<head>Griffith's Poor Day</head>
   <p>Newport had no such qualms and swung at once into their
handling rhythm. But Griffiths, at fly-half, had a bad day. He
dropped many passes and even those that came well to hand. However,
within the first few minutes, a break by Britton in his own half led
to handling by more than half the side and ended with Ford dropping
the ball with Wills waiting for the scoring pass.
   <p>Lewis soon kicked the first of his two penalty goals from the 25
while Willcox failed with a similar shot. But the Oxford full-back
redeemed himself immediately with a splendid tackle on Lewis.
   <p>Just after half-time an unfortunate mistake by Oxford caused the
first Newport try. Ware rushed in from the wing attempting to field a
high punt in the centre of the field, which Willcox had well covered.
They collided, neither secured the ball and, with the right-wing
unguarded, Wills was able to collect and score. Lewis converted with
a fine kick.
<head>LIGHTS ON</head>
<head>Oxford Encouraged</head>
   <p>Oxford's best means of progress was by the boot and it was in
this manner that they secured their only success. McPartlin and
Stafford hacked the ball from halfway, Lewis fell and missed it and
McPartlin went on to score, Willcox converting.
   <p>The introduction of the white ball and floodlights gave Oxford
encouragement. An interception by McPartlin almost led to another
try. Griffiths caught him and Ware was only just held as he struggled
with three Newport men clinging to him towards the line.
   <p>However, Newport recovered their poise and a fine run by Jones
brought another try. Willcox stopped him but Wills was there to make
the touch-down. Lewis just missed the conversion but, when Roberts
was caught off-side in front of the Oxford posts the Newport full-back
added three more points with the last kick of the game.
<head>EASTERN COUNTIES WITHOUT JEEPS</head>
<head>BARBARIANS DOUBT</head>
   <p>R. E. G. Jeeps, England's scrum-half and captain, has had
to withdraw from the Eastern Counties team to meet Devon in the
semi-final of the County Championship at Torquay to-morrow.
   <p>He injured a shoulder playing for Northampton at Bath last week.
R. J. Kent, of Wasps, takes his place.
   <p>Jeeps is playing against Ireland at Lansdowne Road to-morrow week
and he hopes to-morrow's rest will ensure a complete recovery.
   <p>Cyril Davies, the Wales and Cardiff centre, who sustained a
collapsed knee tendon and burst a blood vessel in the match against
England at Cardiff on Jan. 21, may not play for the Barbarians
against the South Africans at Cardiff. He will have a fitness test
to-day.
   <p>Since Davies has also been selected to play for Wales against
Scotland at Murrayfield to-morrow week, it is unlikely that he will
take any risks in turning out for the Barbarians.
<head>Coventry at Guy's</head>
   <p>Price, Coventry's second-row forward and new England
<quote>cap</quote> against Ireland, is recovering from a cold and may not play
against Guy's Hospital at Coundon Road.
   <p>Coventry's other England player, hooker Robinson, has been
selected for the game but may stand down.
   <p>H. J. Wyman, a senior from Bablake School, Coventry,
replaces Cheltenham freshman D. Protherough as hooker for
Cambridge against the Army at Grange Road.
   <p>This will be the only change from the side which drew at
Gloucester last week.
<head>NAVY'S WEAK COVERING LETS SWANSEA THROUGH</head>
<head>By ARTHURIAN</head>
<head>Swansea... 16 pts</head>
<head>Royal Navy... 3</head>
   <p>SWANSEA were too strong for the Royal Navy on a muddy St.
Helens pitch in heavy rain yesterday. Having to concede weight
forward proved too much for the seamen and they lost by two goals and
two tries to a try.
   <p>A lack of determined defence in midfield and casual defensive
covering allowed Swansea to score tries, but it was the greater
experience and vigour of Swansea, with five internationals, which
carried the day.
   <p>After their good display against Newport the Navy failed to
reproduce the same form. Although playing with the wind in the first
half they were never able to control the play.
   <p>At half-back Rodd was closely marked and his partner Francis did
not have a happy match. Consequently the Navy threequarters saw
little of the ball, although Tyrrell tried hard. Cormack was
particularly sound at full-back. Thomas, Jones and Palmer were the
best forwards.
<head>BEST FORWARD</head>
<head>Williams Outstanding</head>
   <p>Swansea's front row of Williams, Gale and Lewis played strongly
with Williams the outstanding forward on the field. Two new halves,
Phillips and Lewis, showed promise, while Mainwaring was a powerful
centre.
   <p>Swansea took the lead after 33min when Navy passing broke down
inside their own half. Harding booted through and followed up,
beating Sinclair and Cormack, to score just short of the dead-ball
line.
   <p>The Navy replied with a try when Thomas robbed Harding after a
line-out and ran through to send Rodd over from 25 yards.
   <p>Early in the second half Swansea took the lead. E. Lewis went
away from a scrum-five outside the Navy line and a long pass to Young
enabled the centre to give Bebb a clear run-in. Mainwaring kicked a
good goal from far out.
   <p>Five minutes later Gale gathered in a short line and dived over
the Navy line for another try. After 15 minutes the Navy again
dropped the ball during passing and Mainwaring gathered to race away
and jink inside Cormack for a good try which he converted.
<head>HOSPITALS MATCH OFF</head>
   <p>The second-round Hospitals Cup-tie between Guy's and Bart's at
Richmond athletic ground yesterday, was postponed because of the state
of the pitch. It has been provisionally arranged for next Thursday.

<head>Sporting Commentary</head>
<head>HOCKEY</head>
<head>JOHN CONROY OUT FOR THE SEASON</head>
<head>BY OUR HOCKEY CORRESPONDENT</head>
   <p>OPPONENTS of England on the hockey field this season will no
doubt breathe more freely at the news that John Conroy, the best
inside-forward of his time and one of the best this country has ever
had, is laid as firmly by the heels as a man can be outside prison.
He is in hospital and there he will stay for the next three weeks to
have a broken ankle bone pinned.
   <p>After that prolonged rest will be necessary. Conroy is out for
the season and the selectors have a problem on their hands in shaping
the England attack, which will make the more senior members, such as
Mr. Harry Lewis and Mr. H. L. Holliwell, think back uneasily
to the 1956-57 season.
   <p>At that time Conroy was in Canada, where he had gone from
Melbourne following the Olympic Games. In his absence England put
into the field the most ill-assorted attack I can ever remember. In
five internationals, ten forwards were selected, the line never played
in the same order twice and England scored just three goals, losing to
South Africa and Germany, beating Wales and Scotland and playing a
goalless draw with Ireland.
   <p>These facts and figures are the measure of the problem facing the
selectors at this moment, with Conroy injured and two other likely
candidates for the forward line, internationals N. M. Forster and
P. B. Austen, not available. They are also the answer to those
critics of Conroy who complained that he slowed up the attack.
   <p>What they meant, of course, was that Conroy did not belong to the
school that bash on regardless and hope for the best. R. D.
Smith, who played outside Conroy on both wings for England, always
says that nobody else could place the ball so perfectly to create an
opening.
   <p>I am sure Smith is right. I am equally sure that more could and
should have been made of Conroy's remarkable gift of ball-control by
moulding the attack round him. That calls for a carefully planned
programme of coaching and training, which in spite of the drive and
enthusiasm of the former match secretary of the Hockey Association,
Mr. L. S. E. Jones, has never so far been achieved.
<head>Lessons from Abroad</head>
   <p>In this respect England, and the other home countries, too, lag
behind what is common practice on the Continent. There it is accepted
that natural talent is not enough and a man must be taught the finer
points of a team game as scientific as football and twice as fast.
   <p>Nothing is left to chance that careful preparation can obviate
and in some cases professional coaches of Indian origin have been
employed.
   <p>Without going as far as that England have for some time had a
national team coach in S. D. Dickins whose methods have made
Hounslow one of the most successful club sides in the country over the
last ten years. Unhappily, Dickins has not so far enjoyed the
financial and administrative backing that a coach must have if he is
to produce results.
<head>TURN OF THE TIDE?</head>
<head>Holland Match Preparation</head>
   <p>There are, however, some signs that the sting of many defeats
suffered at the hands of Continental countries since the war is slowly
creating its own antidote. Plans are afoot, I gather, for a training
programme during the summer aimed at producing an England team to play
Holland in the autumn, a team which will do justice to a match marking
the 75th anniversary of the Hockey Association.
   <p>The idea is to get the probable players and reserves together for
two full week-ends of coaching and training, to include a trial and
wind up with a match which would be a dress rehearsal for the Holland
fixture in October.
   <p>This is good news. England have not beaten Holland in the five
matches played since the war. It is time the tide was turned.
<head>WELCOME EXPERIMENT</head>
<head>Penalty-shot Proposal</head>
   <p>An experiment which all ranks in the game are likely to have on
their hands next season concerns the penalty bully which has been
under fire for some time, mainly on the ground that it is not severe
enough on the offending team. So far no one has produced an
acceptable alternative.
   <p>Now, however, the International Federation are to propose to the
International Hockey Board, the body which makes the rules, that a
penalty shot at goal be substituted for the penalty bully.
   <p>This, it seems, would be a flick or push shot, not a hit, and the
ball would have to be kept below shoulder height. But many details
are still under discussion, such as the distance from which the shot
should be taken.
   <p>The proposal is due to come before the IHB next May. Until
more is known of the details, judgment must be reserved, but the
initiative is to be welcomed.

<head>William Hickey</head>
<head>Jockey judge will ride on Circuit</head>
   <p>MR. JUSTICE DIPLOCK, a 53-year-old Queen's Bench Division
judge, is setting out on Circuit on April 15 despite the pleas of his
wife, Lady Diplock. Circuit, I should add, is the name of his
trusted mount in the Bar point-to-point.
   <p>And Sir Kenneth Diplock, who has ridden in it &mdash; and lost &mdash; as a
Q.C., will be taking part for the first time as a High Court
judge.
   <p>His wife views the undertaking with some trepidation.
   <p>At their home in the Temple last night she told me: <quote>Circuit is
getting old and though my husband rides him every week with the
Cottesmore Hunt I do hope he will not ride him next month.
   <p><quote>I don't want him to get hurt again.</quote>
   <p>But no doubt Lady Diplock recalls an accident in 1957 when her
husband's horse fell and he was badly thrown. His arm was broken and
later he presided at the Old Bailey with his arm in a sling, hidden
under his robes.
   <p>Actually, for any young barrister who wants to have a few modest
shillings on the judge, I am told he is a brilliant rider.
   <p>He will be racing against five barristers.

<head>WORK AGAIN</head>
   <p>CHARMIAN SCOTT, 18-year-old niece of the Duchess of
Gloucester, returned to modelling yesterday for the first time since
the car accident that put her in hospital four weeks ago.
   <p>A fast disappearing scar on her left leg, and a slightly
discoloured eye &mdash; well-camouflaged by make-up &mdash; were the only visible
reminders of the accident, which occurred when a car in which she was
travelling overturned at Hyde Park Corner.
   <p><quote>I still have one or two other bruises,</quote> said Miss Scott,
<quote>but fortunately they can't be seen by the public.</quote>
   <p>She was appearing in a fashion show put on by a Piccadilly firm
in a Park-lane hotel. Among those watching her were her mother,
Lady George Scott, and her elder sister, Georgina, who is a
sales-girl for the firm.
   <p>Georgina does not envy her sister's much photographed fame.
   <p><quote>I'm honest with myself,</quote> she said with a smile. <quote>I know
perfectly well that I haven't got the shape for modelling. So I just
sell the clothes she models.</quote>
<head>SEPARATE</head>
   <p>THE German Ambassador, Dr. Hans \von Herwarth, has
left London to go ski-ing in the Italian Alps.
   <p>His wife left on the same day for winter sports in Southern
Germany and the Tyrol.
   <p>Said a spokesman for the ambassador yesterday: <quote>They usually
take their winter holidays separately. No special significance in
that.
   <p><quote>The ambassador seems to prefer Italy to Austria. I suppose it
is just one of those things.</quote>
<head>Pioneering spirit is still there</head>
   <p>DOROTHY, LADY BRUNTISFIELD, who left England to farm in Kenya
10 years ago, has returned to this country. She has bought a house in
Belgravia, and hopes to move in after Easter.
   <p>When she left England in 1951 she said that Kenya was <quote>a country
of freedom, wonderful climate and no restrictions.</quote> She remained on
her farm &mdash; a lone white woman &mdash; throughout the Mau Mau troubles.
   <p><quote>I was frightened, of course &mdash; who wouldn't be? &mdash; but there was
something worth fighting for,</quote> she told me yesterday.
   <p><quote>Things are different now. We have been let down. And with all
these African politicians making trouble it might blow up into another
Congo any day.</quote>
   <p>Lady Bruntisfield &mdash; first wife of Lord Bruntisfield &mdash; sold
everything before leaving Kenya.
   <p>Lady Bruntisfield, in her late fifties, still retains the
pioneering spirit. <quote>I find building a new home again rather
exciting. It's a challenge you know. And I like a challenge.</quote>
<head>DRAWBACK</head>
   <p>KATHARINE WORSLEY, the Duke of Kent's fianc&eacute;e, made
her first public appearance with the Queen in a theatre outing
last night.
   <p>And unwittingly, poor girl, she committed a minor social sin.
Her deep red dress, I'm told by the women with an eye for these
things, clashed with the Queen's black and plum sequined dress.
   <p>She also discovered one of the drawbacks of royal protocol: she
wasn't able to sit with her fianc&eacute;. The Duchess of Kent sat
between them.
   <p>Also in the party were Prince Philip and Princess
Alexandra.

<head>OLD BOYS</head>
   <p>ONE of London's odder reunions took place last night.
Herr Reinhold Eggers, a former German schoolmaster who was the
security officer at Colditz Castle, the camp for important prisoners
of war, met up with some of his <quote>old boys.</quote>
   <p>He had dinner with Group Captain Douglas Bader at his London
mews house. <quote>I had tea occasionally with him at Colditz,</quote> said
Herr Eggers urbanely. <quote>I always admired his spirit.</quote>
   <p>Earlier I had joined him and Pat Reid, the British escape
officer at Colditz, for a drink in a Knightsbridge pub.
   <p>Herr Eggers has a sense of humour but has never, apparently, lost
his schoolmasterly sense of pained surprise that his <quote>boys</quote> did not
abide by the rules.
   <p><quote>Now Reid,</quote> he said, <quote>was one of my biggest headaches. When
he escaped I was hauled over the coals and almost wished I had escaped
with him.</quote>
   <p>The habit of Reid's which Eggers found most infuriating was when
he sat in his punishment cell blowing derisive blasts of his trumpet
during roll call.
   <p><quote>I can't understand Lord Harewood's interest in music after
Reid's performance.</quote>
   <p>The Earl of Harewood was another of his prisoners. <quote>A splendid
fellow,</quote> said Eggers.

   <p>PRETTY 24-year-old Vanessa Marsh, whose father, Mr.

Catterick Camp.
   <p>She lives in as a &pound;6 10s-a-week assistant cook, preparing
lunch and dinner for the officers.
   <p>Vanessa, who two years ago was to be seen dancing with Mr.
Martin Parsons, half-brother of Mr. Antony Armstrong-Jones,
tells me: <quote>I got tired of riding horses and wanted a change. And
I'd taken a cookery course.</quote>
<head>LANDLORD</head>
   <p>FROM the juke box Elvis Presley throbbed <quote>Are You
Lonesome Tonight?</quote> And on the table-tennis table the portly
gentleman in baggy tweeds finished his game with an adroit smash which
landed the ball smack in the face of his 16-year-old shop-assistant
opponent.
   <p>The Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England, in slightly
unaccustomed surroundings, was opening a new coffee bar at the Arundel
youth club last night.
   <p>The club has 80 members and two rules: no credit and no obscene
language. And since the duke is the landlord of the building (rent
1s. a year) he was the obvious choice as guest of honour.
   <p>The duke obviously enjoyed his table tennis ~(<quote>We have a table
at the castle and I play with the children</quote>), but Presley left him
unimpressed.
   <p><quote>I am a bit old,</quote> he explained almost apologetically, <quote>for
that sort of thing.</quote>
<head>Princess's new house gets &pound;70,000 refit</head>
   <p>THAT'S an end to all those rumours about jobs in the
Commonwealth for Princess Margaret and Mr. Antony Armstrong-Jones.
   <p>After all, no one &mdash; not even the Ministry of Works &mdash; spends
&pound;70,000 on doing up a house if the occupiers are about to go abroad
for a few years. It is clear that the Princess and her husband are
settling down in London and for this purpose 1a, Kensington Palace
(above)

is well suited.
   <p>The house, in the south wing of Clock Court, is one of Sir
Christopher Wren's finest examples of domestic architecture. It was
built about 1690. The front door leads out into the court, giving the
couple far more privacy than they have at No. 10.
   <p>It will take 18 months to put No. 1a in habitable order. It
suffers from bomb damage, dry rot, bad plumbing, and inefficient
heating.
   <p>The money to be spent on Princess Margaret's new home is only a
fraction of a &pound;360,000 plan to give the Royal Family and their staffs
up-to-date accommodation.
<head>William Hickey</head>
<head>Now young Mr. Clore heads for the top</head>
   <p>MR. CHARLES CLORE, The Whitechapel tailor's son who, by his
own ability, has become Britain's best-known man of property, seems to
have passed some of his own brilliance on to his son.
   <p>At an age when most schoolboys are merely preparing for the
G.C.E., 16-year-old Alan Evelyn Clore has been accepted for
Lincoln College, Oxford.
   <p>A fairly remarkable achievement, but I am told that young Clore
has a very lively mind.
   <p>His school friends at Le Rosay School in Switzerland (the old
boys include the Duke of Kent, the Shah of Persia, and the
Aga Khan) describe him as a very likeable lad.
   <p>He has been admitted to Lincoln College without taking an
examination because, I am told, his school work was so outstanding.
   <p>A spokesman for the college says: <quote>He has been accepted as a
Commoner for the academic year beginning in 1962.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Clore adds the information, proud as any parent would be,
that his son will study philosophy, politics, and economics. After
taking his degree he will read for the Bar.
   <p>Mr. Clore's marriage to his French-born wife Francine was
dissolved in 1957. Their two children Alan and his sister Vivien,
who is two years younger, were made wards of court in the previous
year.
   <p>There have been suggestions recently of a reconciliation. Mrs.
Clore, who lives in Paris, is at the moment staying in London.
   <p>But Mr. Clore describes the stories as <quote>a lot of nonsense.</quote>
And his ex-wife tells me her visit is to shop and see her doctor and
dentist.
<head>FLYING OUT</head>
   <p>NINE-YEAR-OLD Christina Onassis, daughter of Mr.
Aristotle Onassis and his ex-wife Mme. Tina Livanos, left
England for Paris yesterday after a few days in Oxford where she has
been visiting her mother, who is in hospital recovering from a ski-ing
accident.
   <p>Christina was driven from Oxford to London Airport in a grey
Jaguar &mdash; accompanied by her nanny, Miss Lehane.
   <p>At the airport they went aboard the aircraft an hour before the
other passengers.
<head>WANTED: A STAR</head>
   <p>MADAME LILY PAYLING, the Australian contralto who many times
packed the Royal Albert Hall before the war, is looking for a British
singer to make into a star.
   <p>Mme. Payling, who now teaches in London, started the Payling
Musical Society after the war. Through it she encouraged many an
unknown singer from obscurity to concert status.
   <p>Qualifications required, apart from a good voice? <quote>Patience and
a lot of hard work,</quote> she said last night.
<head>GOLF BARGAIN</head>
   <p>IT is an object lesson in the concessions one has to make
after marriage. Former Wimbledon champion Budge Patty marries on
April 5 in Switzerland when some of his London friends will be flying
out there.
   <p>At 36 he is giving up full-time tennis, but fears that he will
still be too good to be given a game by his wife.
   <p>And his 26-year-old fianc&eacute;e Macina Sfezzo who has lived
most of her life in Switzerland is an expert skier &mdash; far better than
Patty is likely to become now.
   <p>So they have struck a bargain. Both have started to play golf.
Patty got the idea when he was given a set of clubs for a wedding
present.
   <p>To his surprise he has discovered that although he plays tennis
right-handed he plays golf left-handed.
<head>Cavanagh designs for Katharine</head>
   <p>JOHN CAVANAGH, the crinkle-faced Irishman who started his

her wedding-dress of the year for her marriage to the Duke of Kent.
   <p>Said Cavanagh, 46 and for years the favourite designer of
Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent: <quote>This is one of
the most thrilling things that has happened to me since my shop opened
nine years ago.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Cavanagh has already met Miss Worsley at Kensington Palace

<head>As Tony and topper make an Ascot debut...</head>
<head>THE GRANDSTAND ELITE PLAY ONE-UPMANSHIP</head>
   <p>IT was 6.55 yesterday morning when the Duke of Norfolk
wandered across the green lawns of Ascot. The new &pound;1,000,000 stand
that he had watched rise, brick-by-brick, was clouded with rain. And
the wind had littered the paddock with leaves.
   <p>His Grace ordered the leaves to be removed and the sweepers came
out.
   <p>He prodded the turf and announced that the going would be <quote>a
little soft.</quote> But he looked hopefully at the sky and guessed that
all would come well.
<head>LUNCH CONTEST</head>
   <p>All did. The weather decided to co-operate and Ascot 1961
opened in all its glory.
   <p>The crazy costumes and ridiculous hats... The Royal Family
driving up the course... Antony Armstrong-Jones making his Ascot
debut (he and Princess Margaret were on their honeymoon during the
meeting last year).
   <p>This year there are two sports at Ascot. There is the
horse-racing &mdash; and there is the one-upmanship in the boxes of the new
grandstand.
   <p>Butlers and waitresses join in the second game along with those
who have taken the boxes. They vie with each other to produce the
most impressive lunch.
   <p>This is more difficult than it may seem, for the Ascot caterers
provide all the food. So it is the same for everyone &mdash; from Charles
Clore to the Maharanee of Baroda, from Lew Grade to Lord
Cornwallis.
<head>PASS THE MUSTARD</head>
   <p>Yesterday it was melon and smoked salmon and lobster or a cold
collation (pronounced coalition by at least half the waitresses I
spoke to) and strawberries and cream. Then there were wines to order.
Most people had champagne &mdash; of course.
   <p>Mrs. John Valentine arrived from Sunbury-on-Thames
clutching her cartwheel hat in one hand and a pot of mustard in the
other. <quote>I always like my mustard made with sherry,</quote> she explained.
She wasn't going to risk having the watered kind.
<head>HYLTON'S WINE</head>
   <p>Jack Hylton brought his own wine. A few doors down the
corridor someone had brought a lace tablecloth to replace the damask
ones provided.
   <p>John Topliss-Smith came with a laundry hamper containing
crab &mdash; a present for his host. <quote>Everyone seems to have lobster,</quote>
he said, <quote>but really crab is much nicer.
   <p><quote>The laundry basket? It's the done thing to carry food about in
a hamper, isn't it? And I didn't actually have another hamper.</quote>
   <p>On went the one-upmanship.
   <p>Knowing something of the advantages of a good display, sales
consultant Major Cyril Dennis had pink and white carnations sent
down to Ascot to replace the sweet peas and cornflowers provided in
each box.
   <p>Before anyone arrived in Charles Clore's box part of the flower
display had disappeared <quote>borrowed</quote> for another box.
   <p>There was some swift china-changing, too. Someone slipped into
Lord Moynihan's box and swapped a cracked plate for a sound one
there. And since it was all regulation red and white Ascot crockery,
no one could do much about it.
   <p>George St. John Ervine arrived bearing a silver cigarette
box. An impressive touch, this.
   <p><quote>I was asked to bring it along,</quote> he told me blandly, <quote>to make
the place seem a bit more like home.
   <p><quote>After all, when you come to Ascot you don't want to feel you
are picnicking, do you?</quote>
<head>And of course the family is delighted</head>
   <p>It was the happiest moment of Royal Ascot. The Queen's
three-year-old filly Aiming High had won the Coronation Stakes &mdash; her
Majesty's first Ascot success since 1959.
   <p>And the Royal Family, clearly delighted, went down to the
unsaddling enclosure.
   <p>All the more reason for celebration last night when the Queen
gave her Ascot guests an evening out. They occupied the front two
rows of Windsor's Theatre Royal balcony to see the new musical of
<quote>Jane Eyre.</quote>
   <p>Among the guests &mdash; that eligible bachelor Nicholas Eden,
30-year-old son of Sir Anthony. He sat next to Princess Alexandra.
   <p>We're-all-human quote: During the interval the Queen was heard
to ask: <quote>Please tell me, someone, has this got a happy or a sad
ending? I quite forget.</quote>

<head>Fabiola regrets... but baby is still unofficial</head>
<head>THE STATE VISIT OFF &mdash; FOR <squote>HER STATE OF HEALTH</squote></head>
   <p>IT is not altogether surprising that the Belgian royal family
so often seems to find itself at loggerheads with its subjects.
   <p>Even royal babies, usually a source of national rejoicing, seem
to drive a wedge between King Baudouin and his people.
   <p>There was that rumpus last week when the Pope let slip the
news that Queen Fabiola is expecting a baby.
   <p>But, despite the row, no official announcement followed.
   <p>Yesterday the baby was (unofficially) in the news again. King
Baudouin and his queen postponed next month's State visit to London.
But nobody was prepared to admit (officially) that the baby was the
reason.
   <p>The king's counsellors couched their communique in vague terms.
It merely said: <quote>The queen's state of health and the care it
requires led King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola to express the wish that
the visit be postponed.</quote>
   <p>Not a word about the baby.
   <p>I asked a Brussels palace spokesman if the queen's <quote>state of
health</quote> meant what everybody knew it meant.
<head>NO NEWS</head>
   <p><quote>Of course,</quote> he said, <quote>but we cannot say so officially. We
can only refer to the queen's state of health.
   <p><quote>The fact that the queen is expecting a baby will not be
official until an official announcement has been made.</quote>
   <p>Even our own Queen did not mention the baby when she sent a
telegram to King Baudouin. Taking its tone presumably from Brussels,
it said simply: <quote>I and my husband are so sorry that we shall not be
able to welcome your majesties to London in July.
   <p><quote>We hope soon to hear good news of Queen Fabiola's health and
send you both our best wishes.</quote>
   <p>In Belgium last night, Queen Fabiola's subjects were hoping that
they, too, might hear some good news about her health. Well, some
news, anyway...
<head>SURVIVAL</head>
   <p>Wilfred Noyce, mountaineer, writer and schoolmaster, who was
in Sir John Hunt's Everest expedition in 1953, is giving up his
job as an assistant master at Charterhouse, the Surrey public school,
to concentrate on writing.
   <p>His book South Col described the successful assault on
Everest, and now, I understand, Heinemann will soon be publishing his
latest mountaineering book. It deals with the Anglo-American
Karakoram expedition which he led last year.
   <p>The new life looks promising for Mr. Noyce.
   <p>His wife, Rosemary, told me that Heinemann have also asked
him to write a book on survival &mdash; he published an article on the
survivors of the Agadir earthquake in French Morocco last year &mdash; and
Nelson have commissioned him to edit an atlas of the world's mountain
ranges.
   <p>Another book, on survival in concentration camps, may follow
later.
   <p>Altogether, it looks as if the ex-schoolmaster will have no
difficulty in surviving himself.
<head>Take your pick, says Stokowski</head>
   <p>THAT former fire-eating conductor Leopold Stokowski is a
mellowed man these days.
   <p>In fact, when I talked to him yesterday after his rehearsals for
Sunday's concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra, he told me of his
remarkable experiment in orchestral democracy.
   <p>Time was when this great disciplinarian of the rostrum &mdash; as
fierce as Toscanini in a rage &mdash; had his own starch-like ideas about
orchestral positioning.
   <p>But this week he is allowing the Philharmonia players to decide
for themselves where they sit.
   <p><quote>We try my way and then their way,</quote> said Stokowski. <quote>Then
they will vote on it.
   <p><quote>If they decide that their way will give a better concert I
shall just say <squote>O.K. &mdash; let's have the good concert.</squote></quote>
   <p>He shook his white head and insisted: <quote>But you know, on matters
of intonation and the technicalities I am still more than a martinet &mdash;
I'm a martinetissimo!</quote>
   <p>London-born Stokowski, now 79, has a reputation for highly
individual interpretations. But he is quite prepared, these days, to
be hissed by those who don't approve.
   <p>As he says: <quote>If a man accepts applause when people like what he
does he should be man enough to accept hissing from people who don't
like it.</quote>
<head>ASCOT ENVY</head>
   <p>THEY already have the Kentucky Derby. Now the Americans
would like to imitate inimitable Ascot.
   <p>Mrs. Evelyn Sharp, widow, hotel owner, and millionairess,
is here on behalf of the New York State Racing Commission to
investigate the subtleties of this distinctly British occasion.
   <p><quote>We have our stylish races in America, of course,</quote> she told
me. <quote>But Ascot has an image of its own. We think of it as something
special. The fashions, the parties... everything.</quote>
<head>The Duke of Kent hires a honeymoon plane</head>
<head>COMPLETE WITH HOT AND COLD RUNNING MUSIC...</head>
   <p>The Duke of Kent is going on the second stage of his
honeymoon, to Majorca, in a &pound;420,000 aircraft known as <quote>the
Rolls-Royce of the air,</quote> which he has chartered through Hughie
(Double Your Money) Green.
   <p>The plane is a demonstration model of the 350-m.p.h.
Grumman Gulfstream, the executive aircraft which has already been
bought by such connoisseurs of luxury travel as Greek shipping
millionaire Stavros Niarchos and Fiat millionaire Umberto
Agnelli.
   <p>The Duke's plane, N358AA, is the one in which Mr. Green,
trying to quadruple his money through his partnership in an aircraft
distributing firm, flew the Atlantic earlier this year.
   <p>It has since been on a 70,000-mile tour of 25 countries in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, during which it was flown by
King Hussein of Jordan.
<head>SNACKS...</head>
   <p>The Duke and his new Duchess will travel in comfort. The
24ft. passenger cabin is fitted with a thick royal blue carpet. It
has seating for 12 &mdash; in cosily-padded swivel armchairs.
   <p>The plane has hot and cold running water, a galley where snacks
and hot drinks can be whipped up, a roomy wardrobe, and a handsome
cocktail cabinet.
   <p>And, en route, the couple will be able to enjoy the strains
of I'd Do Anything For You, Dear, Anything, and music from other
current London musicals.
<head>...AND STEREO</head>
   <p>Arthur Willcox, spokesman for the firm which makes the plane
told me: <quote>The plane has a built-in stereo tape-recorder which can
play for the whole four hours it will take to fly to Majorca.
   <p><quote>We are recording hits from the London shows on it. We
understand the Duke likes them.</quote>
   <p>I understand it was Air Commodore Sir Edward Fielden, Captain
of the Queen's Flight, who recommended the aircraft to the Duke after
seeing it at the Paris Air Show.
   <p><quote>This plane is purely a demonstration model,</quote> said Mr.
Willcox. <quote>We don't normally do charters. But we are naturally
honoured that the Duke should have chosen our plane and happy to
oblige him.</quote>
   <p>The Duke and Duchess are expected to fly from Birkhall in
Scotland, where they have spent the first part of their honeymoon, to
London on Sunday. It is likely that they will take off for Majorca on
Monday.
<head>AMERICAN PILOT</head>
   <p>The Grumman, an American plane with 24 p.c. British
components, will be flown by an American, Captain Mike Guididas,
who is the Atlantic Aviation Corporation's senior pilot.
<head>BITTER FIGHT</head>
   <p>Prince William of Gloucester, apparently the only member of
the Royal Family allowed to travel abroad without an escort, spurned
even V.I.P. treatment at Southend Airport yesterday.
   <p>He was off to Calais with a friend, Nicholas Tollemache, son
of Lord Tollemache, and a new car, a Sunbeam Rapier convertible.
   <p>But when the airport commandant, Bernard Collins, invited him
into the special lounge &mdash; cool, quiet and empty &mdash; the Prince turned
him down and went to fight for a ham sandwich and a half of bitter in
the bar.
   <p>He had to wait five minutes before being served.
   <p>Afterwards, drinking his bitter, he explained that he would be
away for about a month or six weeks. <quote>We are going to Paris for a
few days,</quote> he said. <quote>Then making for Greece via Yugoslavia.
   <p><quote>We haven't booked up anywhere. We shall just go where the mood
takes us.</quote>
<head>Today's the day for Bacall</head>
   <p>Lauren Bacall, widow of Humphrey Bogart, is to marry in Vienna
today &mdash; providing some missing documents arrive in time from America.
   <p>She and her fiance, actor Jason Robards, had planned a secret
wedding yesterday.

<head>TUDOR SURPRISE IN TREASURY OFFICE WORK</head>
<head>30FT. LONG WALL AND TURRET</head>
   <p>Reconstruction work on the Treasury offices in Whitehall, which
has been going on for some months behind masses of scaffolding on the
street side and high wooden fences on Horse Guards Parade, has
surprised the Ministry of Works by the amount of Tudor brickwork it
has revealed.
   <p>The most impressive discovery is a length of wall, 30ft. by
16ft., roughly parallel with Whitehall, which includes a great stone
window 20ft. high and 8ft. broad. This is part of the west wall
of the great hall, later converted into a tennis court, which Henry
8 built as an adjunct to Whitehall Palace for the recreation of his
court. The north-west turret of the building, standing to a height of
at least 40ft., has also been uncovered, its upper part faced with a
decorative pattern of flint and stone.
<head>IRON REINFORCEMENT</head>
   <p>The east front of the hall, abutting on to Whitehall, was
demolished by Sir Charles Barry when he rebuilt the Treasury offices
in 1847, but he is credited now with unsuspected forbearance in having
left so much of the west front on the park side. Indeed, the way in
which Barry reinforced the floors with iron albeit at the expense of
thrusting the iron into Tudor window arches &mdash; is assumed by some
experts to indicate that he was deliberately striving to preserve the
west wall of Henry 8's hall.
   <p>Another, but smaller, tennis court which stood near the great
hall was destroyed in the eighteenth century except for its north end
wall. This wall has now been freed from the plaster that has covered
it through the centuries. Today it stands to almost its full height,
with its original windows, of which one, on the ground floor, retains
its Tudor ironwork.
   <p>A two-storeyed gallery, connecting the great hall and the smaller
tennis court, was known to have survived all rebuilding operations in
this part of Whitehall. But the stripping of its wall coverings has
now revealed most of the original window openings and, incidentally,
proved that some of the so-called Tudor windows incorporated in
rebuilding operations were fakes. In the upper part of the gallery
this is clearly demonstrated by a stone Tudor fireplace now uncovered
being considerably out of the line of these sham Tudor windows.
<head>COCKPIT PASSAGE</head>
   <p>The lower part of the gallery &mdash; it was known in former times as
Cockpit Passage by reason of its leading to the long vanished Tudor
cockpit &mdash; has remained in fair shape though cluttered inordinately
with pipes, cabling and all the modern apparatus of a basement given
over to heating and lighting. Eventually it will be cleared of these
things and tidied up to become once more a decent historical passage.
   <p>When the present reconstruction is completed &mdash; probably by
August, 1962 &mdash; there will be incorporated in the new Treasury offices
part of the wall of the Tudor hall and one of its great windows at the
end of a series of corridors.
   <p>The end wall of the small tennis court overlooks Treasury Green,
in the middle of which stands a noble plane tree. When once again
people are allowed to walk from Downing Street to Horse Guards Parade
through Treasury Passage they will see the wall of the small tennis
court and the exterior of Cockpit Passage.
   <p>The original estimate for the reconstruction of the Treasury
offices was &pound;750,000 but it is expected that that figure may be
considerably exceeded.
<head>BENCH REJECT PLEA OVER HANDCUFFS</head>
<head>FOUR MEN ACCUSED OF BANK ROBBERY</head>
   <p>Cardiff Magistrates yesterday rejected an application that two
of four men in the dock should be allowed to have their hands free and
not handcuffed to one another.
   <p>The four men were charged jointly with breaking and entering
Lloyds Bank in Cardiff between January 14 and January 16 and stealing
&pound;9,465 and other property including watches and jewelry.
   <p>Before the Court were: Colin David Baldwin, aged 26, of Braunton
Avenue, Llanrumney, Cardiff; Albert Augustus King, aged 32, of
Southmead, Bristol; Maurice Charles Harry, aged 32, of Northam Avenue,
Llanrumney, Cardiff; and James Bernard Powell, aged 32, of Penarth
Road, Cardiff.
<head><squote>COURT HEAVILY GUARDED</squote></head>
   <p>They were also jointly charged with stealing a car belonging to
Herbert Arthur Peel at Bristol between January 1 and January 2.
   <p>King and Baldwin were handcuffed together, with Harry on one side
and Powell the other side.
   <p>Mr. C. Stuart Hallinan, defending King, asked that the
handcuffs should be removed. <quote>This court is very heavily guarded and
King is prepared to give an undertaking that he will make no attempt
to escape</quote>, he said.
   <p>Mr. K. Rees, for Baldwin, made a similar application.
   <p>Mr. D. A. Roberts Thomas, for the prosecution, opposing
the application, said that when arrested King had stated that he would
not be in custody for long. The two men ought to be held in restraint
because of the danger of escape.
   <p>Mr. Thomas said that entry to the strong room was gained by
blowing a hole through the 18in. thick side wall. More than &pound;3,000
had not been recovered. A fifth man, whose identity was known, was
involved but not before the Court.
   <p>The hearing was adjourned until today.
<head>THE CITY'S SHOPS CUT BY HALF SINCE 1939</head>
<head><quote>FIRM STAND BEING TAKEN WITH DEVELOPERS</quote></head>
   <p>There has been a decrease of 53 per cent in the number of shops
in the City of London since 1939 and 18 per cent in the number of
restaurants, it was stated by counsel for the Corporation of London at
an inquiry yesterday into an appeal heard by a Ministry of Housing and
Local Government inspector. Winmor Properties Ltd. appealed against
a condition imposed by the corporation that provision must be made for
the incorporation of shops in at least two-thirds of the frontage in a
project for rebuilding Nos. 35, 37 and 39, Moorgate as offices.
   <p>Mr. S. M. Haines, architect for the developers, said the
building proposed would be of seven storeys with provision for a car
park. If shops were incorporated in the development they would be
small and spoil the building both architecturally and economically.
The building was intended as an office block.
   <p>Mr. W. J. Glover, for the corporation, said it was the
policy of the Town Planning Committee that existing shops and
restaurants should be replaced in new development. Mr. H. A.
Meeland, planning officer to the corporation, said there had been a
great tendency by developers to omit shops from their plans and the
corporation were having to take a firm stand in the matter.
   <p>The inquiry was concluded.
<head>FORMER HOSPITAL SOLD FOR &pound;7,600</head>
<head>TRING'S CAMPAIGN OVER PROPERTY FAILS</head>
<head>FROM OUR ESTATES CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>TRING Feb. 21</head>
   <p>More than 100 local residents crowded into Church House here
today to attend an auction sale at which the former Tring Isolation
Hospital was finally knocked down to a London financial firm for
&pound;7,600. It went to Mr. A. J. Cruickshank, an estate agent of
Berkhamsted, acting for Bland and Company (Investments) Ltd., of
Wimpole Street, London.
   <p>The final figure compares with a price of &pound;5,000 at which the
buildings were originally offered to the council by the Ministry of
Health, the present vendors, when the hospital became redundant and
which was refused by the council. The sale marks the apparent end of
a lengthy campaign for the hospital buildings to be returned to the
town for at the most a nominal sum.
   <p>Originally a gift to the townspeople by Lord Rothschild in 1901,
the hospital was taken over under the National Health Act in 1948 but
soon afterwards was closed as a hospital and has since been used
partly for storage purposes and also to accommodate a hospital board
official. When the Ministry decided to dispose of the buildings they
were first offered to the council at the district valuer's figure of
&pound;5,000. It was stated that the Ministry had no power to return the
property to the council at no cost.
<head>HEAVY ATTENDANCE</head>
   <p>At the sale, conducted by Knight, Frank and Rutley, local
feelings were shown by the heavy attendance rather than by indecorous
behaviour, and bidding which started at &pound;2,000, rose rapidly to
&pound;6,000, mainly by &pound;25 and &pound;50 advances, changing to &pound;100 advances
in the final stages.
   <p>The buyer declined to give any indication of the future of the
buildings, which lie on a site of just over two acres and include a
five-bedroomed detached house, two small hospital blocks and various
outbuildings. Planning permission has been given in the past for the
conversion of the two ward blocks into residential accommodation, but
the site lies in an area of high landscape value, which would make
extensive development unlikely.
   <p>Mr. F. J. Bly, chairman of Tring Urban District Council,
who with a number of other councillors attended the sale, said
afterwards that the whole procedure which had culminated in the sale
had been grossly unjust. <quote>It was given to the town as a gift,</quote> he
said, <quote>and should have been returned.

<head>PRESS COUNCIL MEMBER RESIGNS</head>
<head>CLASH ON <squote>CHATTERLEY</squote> CASE</head>
<head>FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>BOLTON, Feb. 21</head>
   <p>Mr. Frank Singleton, editor of the Bolton Evening News, and
president of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors, has resigned from
the Press Council. At its last meeting the council expressed
disapproval of the handling of the Lady Chatterley's Lover case by
The Guardian, The Observer, and The Spectator. Mr.
Singleton wrote a letter to The Guardian dissociating himself from
this action.
   <p>Mr. Singleton said tonight that Mr. George Murray, the
chairman of the Press Council, had written to him, saying that the
council would almost certainly regard him as responsible for a breach
of confidence, and that since he had made his views known without
informing the council, he (Mr. Murray) intended to mention the
matter in a letter to The Guardian.
   <p>In his letter of resignation Mr. Singleton wrote to Mr.
Murray: <quote>Rightly or wrongly I felt justified in correcting the
impression in the statement issued to the press that the opinion of
the council was unanimous... It is with sincere regret that I sever
my association with the council on which I have always thought it a
great honour to serve.</quote>
<head>ETON RATE RELIEF</head>
<head>TOWN NOT AFFECTED, SAYS MR. BROOKE</head>
   <p>The rating of public schools was a matter on which the Commons
as a whole should express an opinion, Mr. Mitchison (Kettering,
Lab.) said yesterday when the Standing Committee on the Rating and
Valuation Bill continued its discussion on an Opposition amendment to
rate public schools fully rather than give them 50 per cent relief.
   <p>Mr. Mitchison said that a large public school in an urban
district was anomalous. He hoped to raise the matter at a later
stage.
   <p>The amendment was withdrawn.
   <p>In a general discussion on clause 8, which concerns the reduction
and remission of rates payable by charitable and other organizations,
Mr. Brooke, Minister of Housing and Local Government, said that
boarding schools &mdash; though there were exceptions &mdash; tended to be in the
country in rating areas which were not wealthy. Therefore in many
cases any effect of loss of rates due to the mandatory 50 per cent
derating would be made up by rate deficiency grant.
<head>MADE UP BY GRANT</head>
   <p>In the case of Eton, which had attracted some attention, though
there might be some marginal effect on the county rate, so far as he
could ascertain there would be no effect on the urban district council
rate, because any loss of rate through mandatory relief would be fully
made up by deficiency grant.
   <p>Mr. Brooke said that there was a weakness in the case for
assisting such bodies as learned societies by rate relief because it
meant that local people would have to put their hands deeper into
their pockets. If any such bodies could establish their claim for
relief by means of further contribution from the Exchequer, that would
lie outside the scope of the Bill.
   <p>The clause was approved and the committee adjourned until
tomorrow.

<head>Missing girl found in attic</head>
<head>HUNT FOR A GINGER-HAIRED MAN</head>
   <p>ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD Nancy O'Brien, the girl who was missing from
her home for four days, was kept locked in an attic, it was revealed
yesterday.
   <p>As Nancy haltingly told the story of her four-day ordeal to
police last night, another great search began... this time for a
ginger-haired man the police thought might be able to help in their
enquiries.
   <p>Nancy, who had been missing from her home at Burneside,
Westmorland, since last Thursday, was found yesterday in the locked
attic of a house in Chambres-road, Southport, Lancs.
<head>Hysterical</head>
   <p>The windows of the attic were boarded over. Nancy was
wild-eyed and hysterical... and shoeless. But she was unharmed.
   <p>Last night she was reunited at Southport police station with her
aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson, with whom she lives at
Burneside.
   <p>Last night, too, the police announced: <quote>We want to interview
Horatio Richard Seddon, 28, who can possibly help us in our
enquiries.</quote>
   <p>The police statement added: <quote>We have alerted Interpol &lsqb;the
international police organisation&rsqb; and all ports and airports in our
effort to trace this man.</quote>
   <p>A police description of Seddon said he was about 5ft. 10in.
to 6ft., long-legged, very slim, ginger-haired and wearing
tortoiseshell glasses.
<head>No Reply</head>
   <p>He was believed to be driving an old-type black Standard 14
saloon number ZH2014.
   <p>This was how little Nancy was found yesterday at the house in
Chambres-road...
   <p>At about 11 a.m. screams of ~<quote>Help!</quote> were heard by
Mrs. Winifred Hoyles, 28, who lives next door. She was playing with
her three-year-old daughter, Julie, at the time.
   <p>Mrs. Hoyles said later: <quote>I went next door and shouted, but I
got no reply and thought that perhaps I was hearing things.
   <p><quote>I listened again, and it WAS someone screaming for
help...
   <p><quote>The cries seemed to come from the attic windows.
   <p><quote>I could see these windows were barricaded with boards, which
seemed to be nailed across.
   <p><quote>I rushed downstairs... telling Julie we were just playing a
game, so that she would not get upset.
<QUOTE/>
<head>Ladder</head>
   <p><quote>I went down into the street and stopped two men. They began
to get a ladder to put up to the attic window, and I went to call for
the police.
   <p><quote>The police and the fire brigade arrived and they broke a
window and got into the house.
   <p><quote>I made a cup of cocoa and took it to the attic... and there
was this girl, wearing a green blazer and a dress. She was in her
stockinged feet.
   <p><quote>There were tins of food all over the floor, and there were
women's magazines scattered around. There were also pieces of bread.
There was no bed in the room &mdash; only a mattress.
   <p><quote>Nancy said a man had left her in the attic on Thursday. She
told me:
   <p><quote>He took my shoes away and said it didn't matter how much I
screamed because no one would come.
<QUOTE/>
<head>Screaming</head>
   <p><quote>He locked the door and I couldn't get out. I've been
screaming all the time, and I've been eating out of tins.</quote>
   <p>Police thought last night that Nancy's screams had not been heard
because of thick red-and-white-striped wallpaper which was plastered
over the boards nailed against the attic windows.
   <p>As far as Nancy was concerned, there might have been no window at
all in the room. The only light was from an electric bulb. So, for
four days, she did not know the difference between night and day.
<head>12 MINUTES OF THE DUKE ON TV</head>
   <p>THE Duke of Edinburgh made a twelve-minute appearance on
BBC television last night &mdash; and looked more relaxed than his
interviewer, Richard Dimbleby.
   <p>It was the Duke's first interview on British TV and he
came across like an unflurried man having a cosy fireside chat.
   <p>This pre-recorded interview was for the weekly programme
<quote>Panorama.</quote>
   <p>It was concerned with the Commonwealth Technical Training Week
which opened yesterday.
   <p>The aim of the Week's campaign is to draw attention to the need
for technical training.
   <p>Twenty-eight Commonwealth countries are taking part and in this
country 188 local councils have helped to arrange special events to
boost the campaign.
   <p>In his TV interview the Duke was obviously enthusiastic
about the whole project.
<head>Difficult</head>
   <p>And he had a lot to say about Britain's unskilled workers.
   <p>There were not enough people in industry, he said, who were
technically trained.
   <p>He added: <quote>By far the most difficult problem is this tremendous
attraction of relatively highly paid jobs for unskilled people.</quote>
   <p>Anyone who went into unskilled work, he said, went in at the rate
for the job, regardless of age.
   <p>What many parents did not seem to realise was that a relatively
high wage now might be a rather poor one in after years.
   <p>Britain, said the Duke, could not hope to compete in foreign
markets if industry went on using unskilled labour.
   <p>The Duke pointed out that of 550,000 school leavers aged from
fifteen to seventeen, who started work last year, only 130,000 took
SKILLED jobs.
<head>Snapped Up</head>
   <p><quote>There are all too many people who say: ~<squote>Well, we're not
going to bother to train anybody in our industry because they'll
promptly get snapped up by another industry,</squote></quote> the Duke added.
   <p>During the training Week, factories all over the country will be
holding <quote>open days</quote> to show their apprenticeship schemes to school
leavers and their parents.
<head>A MAN WHO DOES FOUR JOBS</head>
   <p>A BARRISTER told a court yesterday about the man with four
jobs.
   <p>This, Mr. Anthony McCowan told magistrates at Steyning,
Sussex, is the working life of fifty-six-year-old Richard Gilroy:
   <p>As a POULTRY FARMER he works till late afternoon.
   <p>Then he turns to his problems as boss of a WINDOW-CLEANING
business.
<head>Factory</head>
   <p>Five nights a week he works as a LATHE OPERATOR at a
factory.
   <p>In his spare time he becomes a HOME-HELP because his wife is
paralysed
   <p>His total income: About &pound;22 a week.
   <p>Mr. McCowan said Mr. Gilroy, father of two, worked so hard
because his poultry business had not been doing too well.
   <p>Gilroy, of Mill-hill, Shoreham, Sussex, admitted driving while
under the influence of drink.
   <p>He was fined &pound;40, was disqualified from driving for a year, and
was ordered to pay &pound;12 costs.
<head>BARONET'S WIFE NAMED</head>
   <p>A BARONET'S wife was alleged yesterday to have committed
misconduct with a farmer.
   <p>She is Lady (Juliana) Cunliffe-Owen, 32, wife of Sir Dudley
Cunliffe-Owen.
   <p>In the Jersey Royal Court, Mrs. Diana Roberts, wife of farmer
John Roberts, of St. Ouen, Jersey, sought a legal separation on the
ground of her husband's alleged adultery with Lady Cunliffe-Owen.
   <p>In a counter-petition Mr. Roberts asked the court to dissolve
his marriage and give him custody of their two children.
<head>What Labour is &pound;acking..</head>
<head>By JAMES BEECROFT</head>
   <p>LABOUR'S cash problems were discussed last night by Mr. Len
Williams, the Party's National Agent and Deputy General Secretary.
   <p>The Party's National Executive, he said, was considering ways
of increasing Labour's income.
   <p>But whatever was done, the Party would never have funds on the
Tory scale.
   <p>Mr. Williams was talking to more than 300 Young Socialists
attending their organisation's national rally at Skegness, Lincs.
   <p>He stressed that last year &pound;213,000 of the Labour Party's
&pound;250,000 income was contributed by the trades unions.
   <p>The average contribution from individual Party members, he
said, was only 4s. a year.
   <p><quote>Even with the support of the unions,</quote> he went on, <quote>the
amount of money we have today is not sufficient for our Party to do
its job adequately.
   <p><quote>Most of the Constituency Parties are always short of cash.
Many of them are in debt for the last election.</quote>
   <p>The trades unions, said Mr. Williams, had not only been the
main financial support of the Labour Party &mdash; they had been, through
their steadiness, <quote>the ballast which has kept the ship upright in
heavy seas.</quote>
<head>BLOW BY FATHER BLINDED HIS BABY</head>
<head>An <squote>inhuman man</squote> gets six months</head>
   <p>A FATHER struck his six-month-old son across the face so hard
that the baby will be blind for life, a court was told yesterday.
   <p>The father, Charles Wildridge, told the magistrates at Hull,
Yorks: <quote>I lost my temper when he would not take his feed.</quote>
   <p>Wildridge, 37, of Rimswell-road, Hull, pleaded guilty to
assaulting and neglecting the baby, Michael, in a way likely to cause
unnecessary suffering. He was gaoled for six months.
<head><squote>Severest</squote></head>
   <p>The chairman of the magistrates, Mr. J. H. Tarbitten, told
Wildridge: <quote>You are a most inhuman man.
   <p><quote>As a result of striking the baby, he is blind for life. Any
father who does that deserves the severest punishment.</quote>
   <p>Mr. J. F. Croft, prosecuting, said that because of family
circumstances, Michael was kept in hospital for a time after his
birth.
   <p>When taken home, he was normal and healthy.
   <p>Two months later Wildridge &mdash; who has five other children &mdash; took
the baby to a doctor's surgery and said: <squote>He has had a bash in the
face.</squote>
   <p>The doctor was out but his wife called an ambulance when she
saw the child. She thought he was dying.
   <p>Mr. Croft added that in hospital Michael was found to be
blind in both eyes. Most of his face was bruised and X-rays showed
that one leg had been broken but had healed.
<head>Temper</head>
   <p>Wildridge, who is unemployed, told the magistrates: <quote>I was
preparing a meal for my sick wife and the children were coming home
from school.
   <p><quote>When the baby would not take his feed I lost my temper. I have
not neglected or ill-treated the child, and it did fall off a
settee.</quote>
<head>Gardener accused</head>
   <p>ANTHONY Reginald Hitchcock, 29, was remanded in custody at
Newport, Isle of Wight, yesterday, charged with the murder of John
Clarence Neale, 35, his partner in a jobbing gardening business run
from their home, Parkside, Boulnor Park, near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.
   <p>Neale was found dead, with severe head injuries, in the garden of
the house on Sunday. Hitchcock appeared in court handcuffed to a
police officer. He covered his face with his free hand when the
charge was read. The court was told that he had made a statement to
the police.
<head>SHE FELL INTO HP <squote>SNARE</squote></head>
   <p>A WIFE led a perfectly blameless life... until she was
<quote>ensnared in the hire-purchase network,</quote> a court was told
yesterday.
   <p>Said Mr. Patrick Mayhew at East Kent Quarter Sessions in
Canterbury: <quote>In this easy-come system, expensive goods came into her
possession for small <squote>down</squote> payments.</quote>
   <p>Then, added Mr. Mayhew, the wife <quote>succumbed to temptation</quote>
and sold hire-purchase goods so as to keep up the payments on them
   <p>He went on: <quote>The pace got hotter, and the whole nightmare of
deceit collapsed.</quote>
<head>&pound;1,000</head>
   <p>Mr. Mayhew was defending the wife, Mrs. Mollie Joyce
Hawkins, 31, of Hamilton-road, Dover, on charges of theft and fraud.
   <p>More than &pound;1,000 worth of goods &mdash; including washing machines,
TV sets and typewriters &mdash; were involved.
   <p>Mrs. Hawkins mother of four children, was gaoled for fifteen
months
<head>MORE GO ON STRIKE</head>
   <p>THERE were more strikes &mdash; and more people on strike &mdash; last year
than in 1959, but FEWER working days were lost, said the Ministry
of Labour yesterday.
   <p>There was a total of 2,849 strikes, compared with 2,105 in the
previous year.
   <p>The number of working days lost was 3,024,000, compared with
5,270,000 in 1959.
   <p>There were more strikes in coal mining in 1960 than in any other
industry &mdash; 1,666 stoppages, involving 171,000 men.
   <p>The car industry had 129 stoppages &mdash; involving 122,000 men.
<head>Get cracking, Britain, says a union chief</head>
   <p>LACK of leadership, second-rate men in top jobs, and a
general complacency in Britain were slammed yesterday by Mr. Ray
Gunter, MP.
   <p>He was making his presidential speech at the annual conference
of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association at Folkestone, Kent.
   <p>Britain, he said, could no longer afford to allow many leading
positions in industry to be occupied by second-raters who were there
only because of class and patronage
<head>Leadership</head>
   <p>Mr. Gunter, who is Labour MP for Southwark, London,
insisted that the nation's greatest need was dynamic, adventurous
leadership.
   <p>Politicians, trade unionists and businessmen should all
<quote>search their souls</quote> and look ahead.

<head>LINER SINKS, BURNING</head>
<head>Full death toll may never be known</head>
   <p>THE British liner Dara, abandoned after being gutted by fire
in the Persian Gulf on Saturday, sank yesterday while being towed by
the Glasgow tug Ocean Salvor. There was no one on board when she went
down.
   <p>Salvage vessels were being used in an attempt to beach the
liner to let the fire die out completely before she was towed to
Bahrein, but she sank in about 60ft of water five miles off shore.
   <p>It is now estimated that 212 people lost their lives, but it will
probably never be known how many Indians, Pakistanis and Arabs were
travelling as deck passengers.
   <p>Among those still missing are 30 of the crew, a few Europeans,
and an American couple.
   <p>All known survivors have been landed at Dubai or Bahrein. There
is little hope of finding any more.
   <p>Rumours that the fire was caused by a bomb have been discounted.
Indications are that an explosion took place in a boiler space.
<head>&pound;785,000 insurance</head>
   <p>The Dara, 5,030 tons, had more than 700 people aboard when she
caught fire. She was owned by the British India Steam Navigation
Co., a subsidiary of the P. and O. Line.
   <p>Three British frigates helped in the two-day battle to get the
fire out, and it was planned to tow her into Bahrein yesterday.
   <p>The insured value of the hull of the Dara was &pound;785,000. A
proportion of this amount was taken by the owners, and was therefore
uninsured. Of the remainder approximately &pound;15,000 of the reinsurance
was placed at Lloyds.
   <p>The Ministry of Transport will fly out a senior engineer and
surveyor today to make a preliminary investigation into the ship's
loss. A decision whether to hold a public inquiry in London will be
taken after they report.
<head>2,000 stop as convener is suspended</head>
   <p>TWO THOUSAND workers at the American-owned Burroughs
business machine factory at Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, struck
yesterday when their convener was suspended along with two other shop
stewards, the convener, Mr. Callaghan, was meeting the management
over a pay dispute. He was suspended when he refused an ultimatum to
operate the firm's bonus system rejected by the workers.
   <p>On Friday the men had decided to work to rule unless the firm
reconsidered their claim for roughly &pound;1 a week more. They claim the
firm's bonus system only pays flat-rate wages.
   <p>Skilled workers average about &pound;14 to &pound;15 a week.
   <p>Semi-skilled about &pound;11 to &pound;12. Unskilled start at &pound;9 5s.
   <p>A mass meeting will be held outside the strike-picketed factory
this morning.
<head>TEENAGE BAN ROW</head>
<head>Thrasher quits the council</head>
   <p>BECAUSE he thinks an example should be made of teenage
rowdies by <quote>taking their breeches down and thrashing their
backsides,</quote> Mr. Peter Firth has resigned from the urban council at
Stevenage, Herts, where teenagers were banned from the local cinema.
   <p>Tory Mr. Firth, who is 39, said yesterday in letters to the
B.B.C. and Associated-Rediffusion, referring to their programmes
on the cinema ban:
   <p><quote>The aspect of this which appals me is that you took your
cameras to the trouble-spot and to the cafes to  which the
lay-abouts were when not engaged in creating trouble.
   <p><quote>What is the remedy? Is it to spend more money on youth which
we parents eventually have to pay? I do not think so. I think we
must teach by example...
   <p><quote>The thrashing need not be hard. The indignity of having their
trousers taken down would be most salutary and effective. It is also
imperative that we give back to our policemen the <squote>teeth</squote> that they
once had.</quote>
<head>THE <squote>POOR PEASANTS</squote> OF BRITAIN</head>
   <p>A QUARTER of Britain's food is produced by small farmers,
including hill farmers who are <quote>little more than peasants, sweating
out each day without thought or hope of tomorrow,</quote> the Country
Landowners' Association was told yesterday.
   <p>Giving a lecture in Cirencester (Glos), Mr. Travers Legge,
1959 Fison Award winner, said there were 166,000 farms of under 20
acres.
   <p>The hill farmer's life was one of pointless, profitless drudgery,
with <quote>no money to spare for improvements to farm or home or even
things which most of us take for granted.</quote>
   <p>If Britain could reach a stage at which the minimum was 35 to 40
acres of the better land, it would be able to offer competition in the
Common Market <quote>which no country in Europe could match.</quote>
<head><squote>BANISH KILLER DUST</squote> CALL BY WELSH PITS</head>
<head>Daily Worker Reporter</head>
<head>CARDIFF, Monday.</head>
   <p>A CALL for an all-out effort to banish the scourge of
killer dust from the pits has been made by the executive council of
the South Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers.
   <p>Drastic revision of the approved dust standard, which he says is
not a safe standard, is urged by safety officer Linden James, writing
in the current issue of the area's magazine.
   <p><quote>Publicity is the first necessity if we are to get the
extraordinary measures implemented that are necessary to rid mining of
dust disease,</quote> says Mr. James.
   <p><quote>Such measures will cost money and, as there is some reluctance
to spend money, there will be resistance.</quote>
<head>346 in a year</head>
   <p>Dust kills many more people than gas, bad roofs, haulage,
explosives, electricity, and all the other hazards of the mines put
together, he says.
   <p>Between 1951 and 1958 in the whole of Great Britain 183 lives
were lost as a result of explosions in the pits. In South Wales 346
died from dust in 1959 alone.
   <p>Miners who had worked during the long period of <quote>dust-approved
conditions,</quote> including younger men whose whole working lives were
completely within the <quote>suppression era,</quote> had contracted the
disease.
   <p>In some coalfields dust was merely a nuisance. In South Wales it
was a matter of life or death.
<head>Not an excuse</head>
   <p>Present approved standards could be achieved throughout the
coalfield, and in many cases without difficulty.
   <p>As the achievement of these standards was now the ultimate aim,
<quote>the standard has been reduced from an incentive to suppress dust to
an excuse not to suppress it.</quote>
   <p>The existing standard was no longer effective, <quote>and should
therefore be discarded as a hindrance to progress,</quote> says Mr.
James.
   <p>Urging a campaign for improved conditions, he asks the miners to
set their own house in order and make full use of the suppressive
equipment provided.
   <p><quote>Dust kills; if we make dust unnecessarily, we are killers,</quote>
he warns.
<head>POP &amp; GAS BARON FOR AUSTRALIA</head>
<head>Daily Worker Reporter</head>
   <p>THE Queen has appointed a Tory, aristocratic, soft drink,
beer, insurance, gas light and coke, match, banking and estate company
chief to be Governor-General of Australia.
   <p>He is 51-year-old Viscount \de \l'Isle, V.C., chosen to
replace Lord Dunrossil, former Speaker of the House of Commons, who
died in February.
   <p>Lord \de \l'Isle's appointment has caused a certain protocol
confusion, with the Melbourne Herald announcing it first and
congratulating Mr. Menzies, the Australian Prime Minister, on his
<quote>acceptable choice.</quote>
   <p>A little later yesterday Mr. Menzies said he was <quote>delighted</quote>
with the appointment.
   <p>Chief among the new Governor-General's business connections has
been the managing director's post in Schweppes, balanced, of course,
by a directorship in Courage and Barclays.
   <p>He claims descent from the Elizabethan poet and hero Sir Philip
Sidney. Early in the 19th century one of his ancestors named Shelley
came into the Sidney property and had the name added by Royal Licence.
Later he dropped the Shelley.
<head>An Anzio V C</head>
   <p>An Eton and Cambridge boy, he served with distinction in the
Grenadier Guards, winning the V.C. at Anzio.

   <p>He was Tory M.P. for Chelsea for a year at the end of the
war, joint treasurer of the Conservative Party and &mdash; for four years &mdash;
Secretary of State for Air.

   <p>He followed the 3rd Baron \de \l'Isle, who married a daughter of
the 4th Viscount Gort in 1902 and himself married the daughter of the
6th Viscount Gort in 1940. They have four children.
   <p>Australian Labour Party leader Arthur Calwell said yesterday:
<quote>There are many Australian citizens who will fill the office as well
or better than Lord \de \l'Isle will fill it.</quote>
   <p>The Australian Labour Party's attitude was that the
Governor-General must be an Australian, Mr. Calwell added. This
view was supported by the <quote>overwhelming majority</quote> of the Australian
people.
<head>CID IN BREWERY SHARES QUIZ</head>
<head>Daily Worker Reporter</head>
   <p>THE C.I.D. yesterday entered the mysterious situation
surrounding the anonymous &pound;21 million bid for the Liverpool brewing
concern, Bents' Breweries.
   <p>Mr. T. Halton, Bents' chairman, said he understood the City
of London Police and Liverpool C.I.D. were <quote>examining the whole
matter.</quote>
   <p>Two C.I.D. officers saw him and asked him about the
take-over. He told reporters that he welcomed the inquiries.
   <p>The council of the Stock Exchange decided yesterday to allow the
resumption of dealings in shares of the brewery.
<head>Unknown bidder</head>
   <p>Dealing were  banned on Friday because of lack of
information about the bidder, who still has not made himself known.
   <p>Mr. Halton said that he was very pleased dealings had been
resumed. <quote>We did not stop dealings, but we are glad they were
stopped,</quote> he said.
   <p>The brewery owns more than 500 pubs in the North-West. The bid
was made known through Anglasi Nominees. When dealings restarted
yesterday shares fell from the 47s 6d they reached last week.
They closed at 42s.

<head>17 years in a home, she wins release</head>
   <p>THE National Council for Civil Liberties has won the first
case it has taken up before the newly established Mental Health Review
Tribunals.
   <p>The patient, a single woman, aged about 30, whose home is in
Cornwall, is to be released from Rampton in a few days, the council
announced yesterday.
   <p>She had been in mental hospitals since 1944 and the council first
took up her case in 1957.
   <p>The case was presented to the tribunal by one of the voluntary
panel set up by the council to help patients wishing to appeal against
their detention under the new Act.
   <p>An officer of the council said it had hundreds of other cases on

<head>Easier to hook a man in A D 2000 says registrar</head>
   <p>WOMEN should find it easier to get a husband in the coming
years, the Registrar-General forecasts. But, if present trends
continue, they are more likely to suffer a fatal accident in the home.
   <p>The <quote>surplus</quote> of women over men in England and Wales &mdash;
1,510,000 in 1960 &mdash; will have fallen to only 404,000 by the year 2000.
   <p>By then, the Registrar-General says in his return for the quarter
ending last December, the total population &mdash; 45,862,000 last June &mdash;
will have risen to 55,646,000.
<head>Marriage rate</head>
   <p>The marriage rate for 1960 &mdash; 15 people per 1,000 &mdash; was the same
as in 1959.
   <p>In the third quarter of 1960 the rate of stillbirths and deaths
of babies under a week old was 32 per 1,000 &mdash; the lowest recorded.

   <p>Although the total of fatal accidents in the December quarter &mdash;
4,288 &mdash; was 75 fewer than in the previous December quarter, fatal
accidents in the home rose from 1,650 to 1,684.

   <p>Of these 298 were from coal-gas poisoning.
   <p>Only 19 people died from polio in the first nine months of 1960,
compared with 53 in the same period of 1959. But there were three
deaths from diphtheria &mdash; none in the previous period.

<head>College servants join union at Cambridge</head>
<head>By our Cambridge Correspondent</head>
   <p>The first trade union branch for college servants at Cambridge
University was formed last night by 40 men and women &mdash; porters,
gardeners, kitchen staff, and maintenance workers.
   <p>Mr. A. Butterworth, assistant national officer of the
National Union of Public Employees, who advised them on how to form
the new branch, said afterwards that there were more than 1,000 men
and women working in Cambridge colleges who had no agreements on pay
or working conditions.
   <p><quote>The union will strive to bring them all into membership and
seek for them rights equal to those of similar workers in local
government, the health services, and at other universities. From what
I have already heard, the pay and conditions in Cambridge are below
those operative under agreements we have elsewhere.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Butterworth added that one of the first tasks of the union
would be to ask colleges to establish agreements.
   <p><quote>Each college has autonomy. But perhaps the colleges may agree
to some form of negotiating jointly.</quote>
<head>NO CONTRIBUTION</head>
   <p>The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has rejected a

<head>The day everything went backwards</head>
<head>By our Luton Correspondent</head>
   <p>The South Eastern Electricity Board yesterday apologised to
consumers in Leighton Buzzard, Beds., because a technical error
caused their electrical machinery to operate backward.
   <p>The trouble started on Thursday afternoon with a fault on the
main 33,000 volt transmission line and an attempt to end the three and
a half hour blackout by temporarily linking secondary lines was
abortive.
   <p>Mr. Terry Lestor, production manager at a clothing factory,
said:
   <p><quote>Everything went haywire. A light came on warning that power
was restored and the bench motors were started. Sewing machines
worked backwards and the vacuum pressing plant instead of holding
garments down blew them into the air.</quote>
   <p>Other factories sent workers home because there was no power. An
electricity board spokesman said yesterday: <quote>A letter of apology and
explanation has gone to the major consumers. We have explained that a
new supply system will come into use in 10 days and this should never
happen again.</quote>
<head>DRIVING BAN ON JUDGE</head>
<head>Fined in drink case</head>
   <p>Judge David Eyfion Evans, a county court judge in the mid-Wales

for 12 months yesterday for driving while under the influence of

   <p>Judge Evans, who appeared at Builth Wells, was ordered to pay
&pound;38 19s costs.
   His address was given as Plasgwyn, Aberedw, in Builth Wells. He
pleaded guilty.
   <p>Mr. D. Prys Jones, prosecuting, said that on September 22,
Judge Evans's car collided with a stationary car at a cross-road at
Howey. The other car was driven by a Mr. Elwyn Jones, who saw Judge
Evans in the driving seat of his car looking dazed.
   <p>He did not get out and did not answer Mr. Jones when he asked
what he thought he was doing. The two cars were freed, and the judge
reversed away. Mr. Jones again tried to speak to him, but without
success.
   <p>Mr. Jones followed the judge for over three miles, Mr. Prys
Jones said. Both Mr. Jones and his son, who was with him, had said
that the judge drove erratically. His speed varied from about 30 to
50 mph.
   <p>Eventually the judge stopped and told Mr. Jones who he was. He
got out of the car and Mr. Jones had said he staggered on the road.
Mr. Jones supported him to stop him from falling.
   <p>Eventually the judge agreed to allow Mr. Jones to drive him
home in his own car, but on the way began to use threatening language,
and tried to grapple with Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones stopped. Two
police officers then arrived and one helped the judge towards the
police car.
<head>Impeccable record</head>
   <p>County court Judge Rowe Harding, of Swansea, for the defence,
said that he presided over a meeting of the mid-Wales and
Herefordshire branch of the Magistrates' Association at Llandrindod
Wells which was attended by Judge Evans. He had <quote>what appeared to be
a bronchial cold.</quote>
   <p>Dr. John Emrys Jenkins, said he had attended Judge Evans since
1958. His condition had resulted in outbursts of anger and he had
been sharp in his tongue. <quote>I am perfectly sure they were not the
result of alcoholic drinking.</quote>
   <p>Dr. Jack Abbot Hobson, physician at the Middlesex Hospital,
London, submitted a report on the judge's condition. He said that on
the morning of September 22, Judge Evans took three bottles of light
ale and a sherry with his lunch. In the afternoon he attended a
meeting at Llandrindod Wells. He tried to appear normal, although he
did not feel well.
   <p>Dr. Hobson said that Judge Evans was examined at the Middlesex
Hospital, and it was found he suffered from a condition which could
produce symptoms of drunkenness, make him unsteady in his movements
and in his eyes while his speech might be thick. It could also result
in mental disturbances.
   <p>Mr. Alun T. Davies, defending, said that the judge's driving
record was <quote>impeccable.</quote> Twelve months ago he passed the test for
advanced motorists. There was no question of him driving again until
his condition was remedied.
<head>Cashiers coshed and robbed near bank</head>
   <p>Two cashiers employed by Independent Milk Suppliers Ltd. were

&pound;2,000 at Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, London, yesterday. They were

   <p>One cashier was taken to Paddington General Hospital for
treatment. The gang escaped in a car, which was found abandoned
nearby.
<head>Costs for Lord Mayor</head>
<head>BYELECTION CASE DISMISSED</head>
   <p>The Manchester Stipendiary Magistrate (Mr F. Bancroft
Turner) yesterday dismissed a summons against the Lord Mayor of
Manchester (Alderman Lionel Biggs) alleging that, as returning officer
at the Moss Side parliamentary byelection, he failed to discharge his
statutory obligations by not being present on October 25 to receive
nomination papers &mdash; handed in by Mr Walter Hesketh, the British
Union Movement's candidate. Mr Bancroft Turner awarded 20 guineas
costs against Mr Hesketh as a contribution to the defence costs.
   <p>Mr Hesketh said that on October 25 he and Mr Max Moseley, his
agent, visited the town hall to deliver the nomination papers. The
returning officer was not there and, for 5 minutes, town hall
officials were unable to obtain the Lord Mayor. Mr Hesketh said:
<quote>For a long time we were wandering through the passages of the town
hall until I was finally obliged to defer the submission of my
nomination papers.</quote>
<head>Matter of courtesy</head>
   <p>Mr F. P. R. Hinchliffe, for the Lord Mayor, said that
Alderman Biggs, as returning officer, had the right to appoint a
deputy &mdash; in this case the town clerk &mdash; who, in turn, was authorised to
appoint deputies.
   <p>Mr Moseley agreed with Mr Hinchliffe that Mr Hesketh had
received an invitation from the Lord Mayor for all the candidates to
attend the town hall with their nomination papers on Friday, October
27.
   <p>Mr Hinchliffe:
<quote>
Was your reason for not accepting the invitation to appear on Friday
because you didn't wish to be associated with the other candidates in
any way? &mdash; Yes, that was one reason.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Mr Hinchliffe said it had been a practice in the city, as a
matter of courtesy, for the Lord Mayor, to extend an invitation to all
the parliamentary candidates to attend at the town hall at a certain
time with their nomination papers. It was done to prevent the
returning officer or the acting returning officer from being
incarcerated in a certain building from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
five successive days.
   <p>Mr Moseley said that the election officer (Mr Norman \de
Gruchy) told him at the town hall on October 25 that he was no more
authorised to accept nomination papers from Mr Hesketh than a
corporation dustman.
   <p>In evidence Mr \de Gruchy said he did not recall saying he was
not authorised to accept the nomination papers.
   <p>In dismissing the summons, Mr Bancroft Turner said Mr Hesketh
and Mr Moseley had been labouring under a sense of grievance and, to
some extent, it was a legitimate grievance. The important
consideration, however, was that if a member of the public wished to
be nominated as a candidate between certain statutory dates at certain
times, his position should be carefully safeguarded.
<head>Minister rejects corporation's high street plan</head>
<head>By our own Reporter</head>
   <p>A proposal by Southend Corporation for a second high street,
parallel to the existing one, has been rejected by the Minister of
Housing and Local Government, Dr Charles Hill.
   <p>In a letter to the town clerk published yesterday, he says that
the fundamental defect was that the street would serve both for
shopping and as a through-traffic route and the mixture of functions
would be a hindrance to traffic and a danger to pedestrians.
   <p>The proposal formed part of a development plan for the town
centre providing for the expansion of the shopping area, a civic
centre, an office block area, a bus station, car parks and an inner
ring road.
   <p>A public inquiry held last year recommended that the scheme should
be rejected. The Minister, however, has said that he is prepared to
amend it to include all but the new high street and shopping area.
   <p>A spokesman for the corporation said last night: <quote>We have had

Russia was not proposing to supply dried milk to children as a result
of recent tests, he added.
   <p>Mr Rudnev, who was chairman of the State Committee for Defence

<head>EUROPEAN AIR FARES MAY BE RAISED</head>
<head>AIRLINES START SPECIAL TALKS IN PARIS TO-DAY</head>
<head>By Our Air Correspondent</head>
   <p>Air fares in Europe may be increased &mdash; possibly by amounts
between 2 and 5 per cent. &mdash; from April 1 as a result of a special
private meeting of European airlines which opens in Paris this
morning.
   <p>The meeting has been called to discuss the need for the
increases by the International Air Transport Association &mdash; the world's
airline Parliament &mdash; in response to urgent requests from a number of
European airlines who have become alarmed at continually rising costs,
in particular the U.K. Ministry of Aviation's decision to raise
landing fees at its airports by about one-third from April 1.
   <p>All the European carriers, including British European Airways,
will attend, and most of the long-haul operators, including British
Overseas Airways Corporation, who are not directly involved but who
fly over parts of Europe, will be sending observers.
   <p>It is thought likely that at the meeting B.E.A. will fight
any proposal to raise fares, especially at such short notice. The
airline has booked many hundreds of thousands of passengers on the
basis of existing or planned fares levels already agreed, and it is
likely to argue that the administrative problems involved in raising
fares now would be enormous, besides cutting across B.E.A.'s
entire philosophy of getting fares down and keeping them down.
   <p>It is understood that the prime movers behind this virtually
emergency session of the I.A.T.A. are several of the smaller
European carriers, who have in the past been strong opponents of
fares-cutting airlines, such as B.E.A.
<head>TRAFFIC TALKS</head>
<head>Ending <quote>Fares Freeze</quote></head>
   <p>The problem of these smaller airlines is not difficult to
gauge. Substantial cuts in European air fares were agreed, after long
and even bitter argument, at the I.A.T.A. traffic conference in
Honolulu in the Autumn of 1959, to become effective from April 1,
1960.
   <p>At the 1960 annual traffic conference, held in Cannes last
autumn, these earlier cuts were confirmed, and a few further special
European reductions were also agreed, to become effective from April
1, this year.
   <p>The Cannes conference also took the unprecedented decision
however, of declaring what amounted to <quote>fares freeze</quote> for a period
of two years, agreeing that there would be no further traffic
conference until the autumn of 1962, when fares would be fixed for the
traffic year starting April 1, 1963.
<head>LANDING FEES UP</head>
<head>Effect on Costs</head>
   <p>The effect of this would have been to keep European air fares
at their existing levels right up to the spring of 1963, in the face
of rising costs and steadily expanding capacity as more and more jets
joined the airlines' fleets.
   <p>In the event, these rising costs have already overtaken the
airlines. In particular, a good deal of concern has been caused in
European air transport by the decision of the Ministry of Aviation to
raise landing fees at the U.K. airports it controls by about
one-third from April 1.
   <p>A Comet 4B, for example, will now have to pay a basic rate of
about &pound;59 to land at London Airport if the flight originates within
Europe, and a full rate of &pound;115 if the flight originates at a point
beyond Europe. The existing fees are about &pound;44 basic and &pound;84 full.
For a Viscount, the basic rate goes up from about &pound;17 to &pound;23, and
the full rate from about &pound;30 to &pound;41.
   <p>The effect will be to put up B.E.A.'s landing fees for
U.K. domestic flights alone by &pound;440,000 in a full year, and by
probably as much again on its landing fees for international flights.
   <p>B.E.A. has already been forced to counter this by raising
many of its domestic tourist fares by 3 1/2 per cent. from April 1,
cancelling out part of the cuts in those fares it proposed to make
from that date.
<head>FOREIGN AIRLINES</head>
<head>Openly Critical</head>
   <p>Every foreign airline flying to the U.K. is in the same
position. They are openly critical about the higher landing fees, and
it is understood that the Ministry's decision will be cited by many at
the Paris meeting as one of the principal reasons why air fares in
Europe must rise &mdash; and rise from the same date that the higher landing
fees become effective.
   <p>In order to protect its bookings position &mdash; and its avowed
long-term aim of slashing fares &mdash; B.E.A. will probably try to
resist the strong efforts that will be made in Paris to raise fares,
but it may well be obliged to concede something.
   <p>One possibility is that it may win a respite, with fares being
raised by small amounts at a date later in the summer or in the
autumn. Whatever the outcome, it is already clear that the Paris
meeting will be difficult, and perhaps even stormy.
<head>&pound;12m. Order for Boiler Consortium</head>
<head>By Our Industrial Correspondent</head>
   <p>The first boiler contract for the recently formed consortium of
John Brown Land Boilers and Foster Wheeler was announced yesterday by
the Central Electricity Generating Board.
<head>Shared Contracts</head>
   <p>The consortium, which was formed last month, is to supply four
350,000 kilowatt boilers, at a cost of over &pound;12m., to the Tilbury B
power station. The steam condensers are to be supplied by Richardsons
Westgarth (Hartlepool).
   <p>There is considerable over-capacity in the boiler industry, and
it has become the C.E.G.B.'s practice to spread the large
contracts between two manufacturers. Thus the boiler order for the
new West Burton power station in Nottinghamshire was shared between
Simon-Carves and International Combustion, and, as reported last week,
a further &pound;20m. order was awarded to Babcock and Wilcox and Yarrow
and Company.
   <p>The new Tilbury contract will represent a much-needed addition of
new work for the two companies concerned. Lord Aberconway, chairman
of John Brown, said last year that the 1959 boiler order for the
Bankside power station was the only order received by the company from
a British generating authority for more than four years.
<head>Service Dates</head>
   <p>The first two turbo-alternators are due for commissioning in
1965 and the remaining two in 1966. The generators, as reported
earlier this week, are being supplied by General Electric at a cost of
&pound;8m.
<head>CHAIN OF SHOE SHOPS FOR CO-OPERATIVES</head>
<head>From Our Own Correspondent</head>
<head>MANCHESTER, March 22.</head>
   <p>The Co-operatives are to set up a country-wide chain of shoe
stores known as Society Footwear. If the new organisation is a
success, it is likely to spread to other trades, including radio, and
electrical goods.
   <p>Fifty-six Co-operative retail societies have already indicated
their readiness to join the English and Scottish Wholesale Societies
in the new venture which follows the independent commission's
recommendation in 1958 that the Co-ops. should establish chains of
specialist shops.
   <p>Some of the largest retail societies are among those joining.
They include the London Society, the Royal Arsenal, the South
Suburban, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth, Newcastle-on-Tyne and
the Co-operative Retail Service, a big amalgamation of societies.
   <p>Each retail society will invest &pound;5,000 for every shoe shop it
plans to open. This will give the chain an initial capital of over
&pound;500,000 &mdash; half provided by the retail societies and half by the
C.W.S. and S.C.W.S. The shops will not stock only
C.W.S. shoes. <quote>We realise that the customer wants a range of
choice,</quote> said a spokesman in Manchester to-day.
   <p>Existing Co-operative shoe shops will not be affected. <quote>We
shall start shops in places where there is the trade available and
where the societies have not been able to develop so far.</quote>
   <p>Mr. R. Southern, chairman of the C.W.S. Board's retail
trading committee and one of four directors nominated by the wholesale
societies to act as a caretaker Board in the early stages, said
to-day: <quote>Behind the new organisation will be the vast financial and
technical resources of the C.W.S. and the S.C.W.S. Our
shops will be as attractive and modern as any in the country.</quote>
   <p>It is not yet known how many shops the new chain is likely to
have, but the immediate target will probably be in the region of 100.
<head>France to Cut Some Customs Duties 5% on April 1</head>
<head>From Our Own Correspondent</head>
<head>PARIS, March 22.</head>
   <p>New tariff cuts of 5 per cent., to come into force on April
1, were approved by the French Council of Ministers to-day.
   <p>Reductions apply specifically to the Six countries of the
Common Market but, in some circumstances, they will also affect
imports from outside. It is understood, however, that British and
American cars will not benefit from the reductions.
   <p>The full details of the reductions will not be known until the
decree appears in the official journal to-morrow or even a day after.
<head>In Anticipation</head>
   <p>It was stated that the decision was taken in anticipation of
the 10 per cent. reduction within the Common Market which takes
place automatically at the end of the year. It was indicated at the
same time that the cuts would apply to all countries providing that
the resulting duties did not fall below the common external tariff of
the Six.
   <p>One of the immediate results will be to nullify the effects of
the recent revaluation of the D-Mark on the prices of German exports
in the French market. It is not quite clear exactly how the
reductions are to be applied. In the past few weeks there has been a
prolonged discussion between Ministries as to whether the cuts should
apply uniformly across the board or should vary with different
products. It is, however, reported that the tariff on textiles and
cars imported from the Common Market are  to be reduced by 10
per cent.
<head>Checking Prices</head>
   <p>The Ministry of Finance said that the reductions now approved
were designed to check the upward trend in prices. This is one more
indication of the French Government's determination to sweep away
protective habits of mind.
<head>DR. HELLER SEES SIGNS OF U.S. RECOVERY</head>
<head>From Our U.S. Correspondent</head>
<head>NEW YORK, March 22.</head>
   <p>The widespread belief that the recession may have reached its
turning point was endorsed to-day by President Kennedy's chief
economic adviser, Dr. Walter Heller.
   <p>Dr. Heller said that with signs pointing to a bottoming-out of
the recession the <quote>odds are not very strongly in favour</quote> of a
temporary tax cut to stimulate business.
<head>Aid for Workless</head>
   <p>The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers made his
remarks as Congress was preparing to send the first of Mr. Kennedy's
anti-recession Bills to the White House for signature. The Bill,
providing $990m. (&pound;353,570,000) in additional aid for unemployed
who have exhausted their benefits, followed on the heels of the Feed
Grains Bill passed earlier in the day &mdash; after two months in office
President Kennedy has now seen his first major proposals enacted into
law.
   <p>So far his programme has survived its progress through Congress
relatively unscathed, but the most contentious matters have still to
come up for consideration. The chances of some of the latter may
suffer through a pick-up in business conditions which, Dr. Heller
said to-day, might be relatively early. But he emphasised that only a
relatively slow return to full employment could be expected.
   <p>The Administration is striving to persuade Congress that a
turn-round in business does not obviate the need for such measures as
pension liberalisation &mdash; scheduled for April 1 by the President but so
far given no attention by Congress &mdash; and a rise in the minimum wage,
which comes up for House debate this week.
   <p>The sluggishness of the Congressional pace is partly explained by
conservative opposition to much of the President's programme.
   <p>But another reason is that Congress is simply not geared to cope
with the flood of proposals that has poured from the White House on a
scale only matched under President Roosevelt.
<head>AN IRREGULAR TURN IN EQUITIES</head>
<head>GRATTAN WAREHOUSES' PROFITS UP 12%</head>
<head>By LEX</head>
   <p>Industrial equities developed an irregular turn yesterday.
Early marking down on the view that the rise had been a little fast
failed to bring out much stock. Price movements were finally mixed

   <p>Volume was substantial again and the undertone still firm.

<head>A SIXPENNY BARGAIN AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE</head>
   <p>AN unchanged dividend of 300 per cent. is being paid on the
Ordinary shares of Neville Developments. And thereby hangs a tale &mdash;
and a great deal of money.
   <p>Neville Developments is a Birmingham company run by shrewd
chartered accountants. It has a number of operating subsidiaries, but
its main function is that of an issuing house specialising in
transforming private companies into public concerns.
   <p>And highly profitable that business has proved. The company's
shares are among the cheapest ever brought to market.
   <p>Their nominal value is 6d., but their market value is around
50s. Earlier this year they were worth more than &pound;3 each.
   <p>Profit figures for 1961, out this morning, will prove rather
disappointing to shareholders. They amount to &pound;471,000, which is a
drop of &pound;312,000 from the year before.
   <p>But these shareholders are in no need of sympathy. They are in
the big money. Let me briefly retrace the golden road.
<head>MAKING MONEY</head>
   <p>In 1958 the then 2s. Ordinary shares are placed at 3s.
each. In September, 1959, they were divided into one sixpenny
Ordinary share and three sixpenny Deferred Ordinary shares. The
Deferred get no dividend until 20s. had been paid on the Ordinary.
   <p>Anybody who invested &pound;100 in these shares in 1958 would now have
666 Ordinary shares worth more than &pound;1,300, plus 2,000 Deferred
shares &mdash; which have no market quotation yet but are surely going to be
valuable later.
<head>BEER WEDDING</head>
   <p>EVERY expert in the beer business has been prophesying that
the trade will be concentrated into fewer and fewer units.
   <p>Today the big Yorkshire combine, John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery,
reports that it is having merger talks with Warwick and Richardson,
the brewers of Newark, Notts.
   <p>Already this year John Smith's has bought up Yates' Castle
Brewery.
   <p>The 5s. shares of Warwicks and Richardsons are currently quoted
at around 22s. So the take-over terms should be interesting.
<head>SHARES MOVE UP</head>
   <p>AFTER a dull start, prices moved ahead again yesterday on
the Stock Exchange.
   <p>Business was small, but some of the gains were worth having.
Steel Company of Wales rose 1s. 3d. to 35s. 6d., Pru <squote>A</squote>
17s. 6d. to &pound;23 18s. 9d., and Threlfall's Brewery 2s. to
90s.
   <p>In the paper section, Bowater put on 1s. 3d. at 46s. 3d.,
while Penguins rose 10 1/2d. to 20s. 4 1/2d.
   <p>Imperial Chemicals gained a further 1s. at 61s. 6d. and
Typhoo Tea 1s. 3d. at 35s. 4 1/2d.
   <p>In oils, Burmah, which announces a three-million-dollar share
purchase in Great Plains Development Co. of Canada, and a
4,500,000-dollar option on more shares, rose 1s. to 34s. 1 1/2d.
<head>WHERE MONEY GOES</head>
   <p>HOW do we invest the millions of pounds we all own as
tax-payers? A White Paper, out today, reports that expenditure on the
programmes of the nationalised industries, the public corporations and
the Post Office accounts for one half of all public investment.
   <p>Largest absorber of capital is the electricity industry, followed
by the British Transport Commission and the Post Office.
   <p>About two-fifths of our public money goes to local authorities,
who spend it chiefly on housing and education.
   <p>Enormous sums are involved. Total investment this year is
estimated at &pound;1,755million. And next year &mdash; that is, the year
ending April 1963 &mdash; it might be &pound;200million more.
<head>RISING VALUES</head>
   <p>THE &pound;1 Ordinary shares of Sopers of Harrow, Middx, the
store firm, are worth &pound;48 10s. each. That is what Debenhams, which
already owns most of those in issue, are offering for the remaining
4,135.
<head>Boom time &mdash; and Bank rate may be clipped</head>
   <p>ALL was merry and bright along the golden pavements of the
City yesterday. Everybody believes the Bank rate will be cut again
today.
   <p>If it is not, some bold speculators will lose money. Yesterday
they were backing their fancy with hard cash, and shares enjoyed their
best day for a long time.
   <p>The Financial Times index rose by 4.6 points, which
represents a jump of many millions in share values.
   <p>Metal Box, the can giant, rose 2s. 4 1/2d., Imperial
Chemicals 2s., Beechams 1s. 9d., Typhoo Tea 2s.
   <p>In banks, Westminster <quote>B</quote> and Lloyds both put on 1s. 9d.,
while Prudential <quote>A</quote> rose &pound;1 to &pound;24 18s. 9d.
   <p>Courage and Barclay frothed up 1s. 6d. and Bents Brewery rose
2s. There was less excitement in the gilt-edged market. But gains
of up to 6s. 3d. were recorded.
<head>EXPANSION</head>
   <p>SIR CLAVERING FISON'S report should be in the hands of his
shareholders today. But it is already out of date.
   <p>He reports that the capital projects approved total &pound;13,500,000,
most of which is for the proposed great nitrogen plant at Milford
Haven.
   <p>Sir Clavering told me yesterday that this figure has now become
an overstatement. The Milford Haven project has been modified. There
is now no plan to raise fresh capital, certainly not in this financial
year.
   <p>Although group sales of this great fertiliser and chemical
combine rose by &pound;3million last year to &pound;54million, the profit came
down by &pound;900,000 to &pound;3,607,000. Even so it was the second highest
figure in the company's history.
<head>BOOMING BUTLIN</head>
   <p>MR. BILLY BUTLIN was host last year to more than 600,000
paying guests. This year the figure should be larger still, because a
new camp, in Minehead, Somerset, will be open.
   <p>The joy in the chalets certainly spreads to the shareholders, who
must regularly rise and bless the name of Butlin.
   <p>Last June these lucky owners, having had a dividend for the year
of 80 p.c., learned that their shares were being doubled by a
capital bonus.
   <p>Yesterday, Mr. Butlin announced that the interim dividend on
this new capital is raised to 15 p.c., and he forecast a final of
not less than 40 p.c. &mdash; a total of 55 p.c.
   <p>He also revealed that the full figures for this year will show an
increase in revenue of &pound;1,500,000. He added that the rise in the
half-yearly dividend is small only because the Chancellor has called
for restraint.
<head>PROFITS JUMP</head>
   <p>THERE is surprisingly good news this morning from Sir Ivan
Stedeford, master of mighty Tube Investments.
   <p>He reports a jump in profits of &pound;3million to a record
&pound;27million. The figure, of course, includes for the first time the
profits of acquired Raleigh Industries, but we already know that these
declined last year.
   <p>In addition, the figures now out reveal that the earnings of a
major subsidiary, British Aluminium fell last year by &pound;1,500,000.
   <p>So the group profits make pleasant reading to shareholders.
Dividend is 14 p.c. which is the equivalent of 18 p.c. paid
last year.
   <p>This news came after the stock market had closed. But it was
greeted with a cheer. In after-hour dealings the &pound;1 shares jumped
5s. to 67s. 6d. No wonder.
<head>A NEW WEAPON IS LAUNCHED IN THE LAGER WAR</head>
   <p>FOUR big brewers have joined in an unequal partnership to
produce and market a new lager, Harp.
   <p>They are Guinness, Courage, Barclay and Symonds, Mitchells and
Butler and the Scottish and Newcastle Breweries.
   <p>And it was Lord Boyd, vice-chairman of Guinness &mdash; formerly Mr.
Lennox Boyd &mdash; who in his best front-bench manner yesterday launched a
campaign at the Dorchester Hotel to make us drink Harp on a national
scale.
   <p>Now nearly all the big brewers &mdash; Bass is a notable exception &mdash;
are committed to the struggle for the new drinking market.
<head>BIG BUSINESS</head>
   <p>HUGE money is at stake. Ind Coope is spending millions to
make and market Skol. The four groups who will strum the harp have
combined assets of over &pound;200million.
   <p>Can these huge investments pay off? The brewers think so and
they will be right if enough of the drinking classes change their
taste.
<head>DIVIDEND SHOCK</head>
   <p>SHOCK news for shareholders of Gas Purification and
Chemical, the Grundig company. They are to get no dividend this year.
Last time they were paid 35 p.c.
   <p>No wonder! Against last year's profit of &pound;811,000, there is
this year a loss of &pound;15,000.
   <p>When the news broke yesterday the 5s. shares dipped to 5s.
9d. But they recovered later to 6s. 7 1/2d., a fall of 10
1/2d. on the day.
<head>MORE DOWN</head>
   <p>STOCK markets yesterday were still falling under the
influence of recent adverse company news.
   <p>Wiggins Teape, papermakers, tumbled 2s. 3d. to 50s. 9d.
and Villiers Engineering, on bad results, 1s. 3d. to 6s. 9d.
   <p>Full details of the merger lowered both Rank Organisation and
Gaumont British by a shilling.
<head>HOLDING THE LINE</head>
   <p>DIRECTORS of Ault and Wiborg, the makers of printers' inks,
have continuing good news for their shareholders.
   <p>Half year's profit to September 30 last is &pound;14,000 higher at
&pound;515,000 and the interim dividend of 3 1/4 p.c. is the
equivalent of 6 1/2 p.c. paid last year before the hand-out of a
100 p.c. capital bonus.
<head>NO BONUS</head>
   <p>SHAREHOLDERS of Fry's (London), makers of Enox hand tools,
must do without a special bonus this year &mdash; last time it was 2 1/2
p.c.
   <p>A final dividend of 10 p.c. brings the total distribution up
to 17 1/2 p.c. compared with 20 p.c. a year ago. Reason for
the cut is a &pound;19,000 fall in profits at &pound;54,300
<head>WAGON TAKE-OVER</head>
   <p>DIRECTORS of Winget, the Kent engineers, and the Gloucester
Railway Carriage and Wagon Company have at last agreed on terms for a
merger.
   <p>Winget will offer the following share-exchange terms to holders
of Gloucester Wagon shares: two Winget Ordinary, plus &pound;4 19s.
nominal of Convertible loan stock, for every nine Gloucester shares.
   <p>Last month Sir William Morgan, chairman of Gloucester Wagon, said
that when existing orders are completed the company would stop making
rolling stock for railways, and the main works would be closed down.
The merger should alter things.
<head>HOME SEEKERS FACING BAD WINTER</head>
   <p>WHAT do you do nowadays if you must buy a house? One major
authority on the subject today declares: <quote>It will be a hard winter
for the home buyer.</quote>
   <p>The authority is the Building Societies Gazette. And I
agree with it.
   <p>The facts are, as the Gazette points out, that when the banks
and insurance companies are not lending money all home buyers turn to
the building societies.
<head>BARGAINS</head>
   <p>These, although they have large funds, haven't got anything
like enough money to meet the huge demand. And building society
managers are not keen to lend large sums on expensive houses.
   <p>Some houses, it is true, might now fall in price, particularly
the pre-1919 houses, since the Government's lending scheme on these
has been abandoned.
   <p>But the societies don't want to lend money on these old houses.
So in that case, too, the young home-builders will be frustrated.
   <p>For these houses, and some others, the winter could be a bargain
time for the man with ready cash who can pay the full price. But how
many young home-makers are in that position?
   <p>So young lovers move into a queue that goes on lengthening.
   <p>Says the Gazette: <quote>We wish them joy as they trudge from
society to society. We wish that Mr. Selwyn Lloyd could go with
them to listen to their interviews with building society branch
managers. Or perhaps they would prefer more cheerful company.</quote>
   <p>Perhaps they could have the cheerful company of Mr. Lloyd's new
right-hand man, Mr. Henry Brooke, whose set-the-people-free Rent Act
brought about this remarkable situation. The tragedy is that he's
proud of it.
<head>PROFITS SLIM</head>
   <p>TWO major British companies, Courtaulds, the man-made
textile giant, and Wiggins Teape, the paper-making combine, issue
ominous statements. The theme is the same: higher sales but smaller
profit.
   <p>Cortaulds' sales for the half-year to September 30 were
&pound;3,600,000 higher at &pound;83,451,000 but profit in the six months
declined by nearly &pound;2 million to &pound;7,586,000.
   <p>And there is a small but severe shock for shareholders. Their
interim dividend is cut from 10d. to 9d. &mdash; that is, from 4 1-6
p.c. to 3 3/4 p.c.
   <p>Final dividend last year was 5 5-6 p.c. to make 10 p.c.
for the year.
   <p><quote>Present indications suggest,</quote> say the directors, <quote>that
profits for the second half-year should be of the same order.</quote>

<head>Familiarity Breeds Discrimination</head>
<head>World of Music: By MARTIN COOPER</head>
   <p>AS Europe and America slowly approach a cultural unity
which must eventually shame the politicians into following suit, the
old concept of local or national reputations in the arts is being
discarded.
   <p>Until 1940 it was an observable fact that there were composers
whose music was highly prized in some countries and entirely neglected
by their neighbours, and this was explained by the difference in
national characters.
   <p>It is not so very long ago that Brahms met with bored
incomprehension in Latin countries, that Bruckner and Mahler were
regarded as exclusively Teutonic, Faur&eacute; exclusively French, and
Nielsen exclusively Scandinavian, while Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians
marvelled at their own particular appreciation of Sibelius, Delius or
Vaughan Williams.
   <p>Now, however, the wider musical exchanges made possible by
broadcasting, recording and the international tours of major
orchestras have made ignorance and prejudice inexcusable and greatly
reduced the area in which national temperament seriously limits the
appreciation of any music. What were formerly regarded as limitations
in the sensibility or intelligence of the public begin to appear
rather as flaws in the composers concerned, and the importance of
those flaws is revealed in each case by the degree to which an
international, as opposed to a merely local, public can be persuaded
to overlook them.
   <p>Brahms is now universally accepted at an estimate well below that
current in Britain and Germany when he was placed beside Bach and
Beethoven, but enormously higher than that which once virtually
dismissed him from French and Italian programmes. Bruckner is
gradually becoming known and appreciated outside the Germanic
countries in exactly the same way, not as the equal (let alone the
superior, as some enthusiasts have suggested) of Beethoven but as a
great and unique figure in the history of the symphony.
   <p>
   <p>MAHLER's case is slightly different, since he has always
been neglected in his native Austria and has appealed more to
individuals (Casella, for instance, was an improbable champion) than
to national groups. The uneven value of his symphonies becomes
clearer as they are more performed, but at least three of them are now
repertory works here and in America, and the remaining six obtain
festival or occasional performances, while the songs are universally
acknowledged.
   <p>Faur&eacute;, once dismissed as a French trifler, is now recognised
as a minor master in the field of piano and chamber music, and
something greater as a song-writer (could anyone have prophesied even
20 years ago that the greatest German lieder-singer of the day would
record a Faur&eacute; song-cycle as Fischer-Dieskau has done?). Nielsen,
like Mahler, has a strong personal following outside Scandinavia and
individual works have found their place in the repertory here.
   <p>The position of the great Anglo-Saxon favourites, on the other
hand, is quite different owing to the extraordinary instability of the
Anglo-Saxon public, which has shown itself infinitely suggestible,
knowing nothing between uncritical enthusiasm and blank
incomprehension. This lack of critical discrimination, which can be
observed in our attitude towards performers as well as composers, is
the price we pay for our provincial position on the periphery of the
great Western European musical tradition, our failure over two
centuries to sustain any strong national musical tradition of our own.
   <p>Handel, Mendelssohn and Gounod were all in their turn
astonished &mdash; and, being human, delighted &mdash; by the adoration that their
works received in this country. In our own day Delius was quite aware
that his music was enjoying a vogue that carried no guarantee of
duration and Harold Johnson has recently revealed Sibelius's pleased
but uneasy astonishment at finding himself acclaimed in England and
America as the greatest living composer.
   <p>Vaughan Williams's position as chief of the belated nationalist
revival in this country seemed to promise greater security for his
music; but, like Delius and Sibelius, he has not grown into a larger,
more universal musical figure since his death.
   <p>
   <p>SEVERAL correspondents have recently accused me of
belittling, or at best <quote>damning with faint praise,</quote> the music of
these three composers. But any praise must seem faint after the
extravagant paeans that it has prompted in the past; and is it
belittling a composer who has been too easily proclaimed a giant to
attempt a more objective estimate? The violent opposition that these
composers have certainly aroused in some quarters does not spring from
an objective valuation of their music so much as from the fact that
their music was used as a kind of smokescreen to hide from the public
the revolutionary works of Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Bartok.
   <p>Now that we have begun to become familiar with these, we can also
begin to discriminate in our judgments of Delius, Sibelius and Vaughan
Williams &mdash; to sift their major from their minor achievements and to
see them in perspective against the music of their great
contemporaries.
<head>Gaining from the Right Setting</head>
   <p>THERE can be few sights in Northern Europe more beautiful
than the first view of the three massive towers of Bruges, giant
figures dominating a rather desolate landscape, as one approaches the
town across the flat coastal plain.
   <p>Bruges itself, with its belfry <quote>old and brown,</quote> still
preserves many signs of its mediaeval prosperity and it provides an
incomparable setting for the S&eacute;minaire Europ&eacute;en de Musique
Ancienne.
   <p>Some five years ago the Belgian Ministry of Education, a
department generous in its subsidies to the arts, conceived the
admirable idea of asking Stafford Cape, the musicologist and director
of Pro Musica Antiqua, to organise at the College of Europe in
Bruges a summer course in mediaeval and renaissance music.
   <p>Every year since 1957 students from all over the Continent,
recommended by their Governments, have met in Bruges for three weeks.
The complete course takes three of these sessions, so that this year
was the second year of the second course.
   <p>There were altogether 24 students from 14 countries, among them
three students from England and one, a lutenist, from distant Finland.
Each day they attended lectures and made music informally together.
<head>COINCIDENCE</head>
   <p>By a happy chance, the course coincides every second year with
the Biennale Internationale de Po&eacute;sie, a gathering of poets
from all over the world, in the nearby seaside town of Knokke, and it
has now become the custom for the students of the \S&eacute;minaire, under
Stafford Cape's direction, to give an evening concert in the Casino.
This they did last weekend, offering to a large international
audience a fascinating programme of French and Italian 14th-century
music and works of the Burgundian school. Almost every student took
part, either playing or singing, sometimes putting aside an instrument
to join in an unaccompanied motet or movement from a Mass.
   <p>Remembering that these students had been working together for
only a few weeks, that many of them had little previous knowledge of
early music and that some were not professional musicians, one could
only marvel at the progress they had made, not only in individual
performance but in a general musical understanding of a period that
often seems remote and inaccessible.
   <p>In Dufay's <quote>La belle se siet,</quote> for example, two sopranos,
one from France, the other from England, sang easily and with obvious
enjoyment in old French, as though they had been preparing the piece
for months instead of weeks. Much of the music performed was of great
contrapuntal complexity and profound religious feeling; that they were
able to bring to it such style and insight after working together for
so short a time was proof both of the students' devotion and of the
enlightened direction of Mr. Stafford Cape.

<head>The Only Real Guide to Play-going</head>
<head>About the Theatre: By W. A. DARLINGTON</head>
   <p>PEOPLE quite often write to ask me to choose plays for
them, and it is quite natural that they should. Here I am at their
service, and I do my best to comply. But I sometimes wonder if they
realise how difficult the task is. They are asking me to look at
plays through their eyes, when my whole working life is spent
examining them through my own.
   <p>It is like being made to read through somebody else's spectacles.
   <p>All valid criticism is informed personal opinion. That is a
truism which will be questioned hardly anywhere, except in some
quarters in America, where the collective opinion of the uninformed
man in the street is thought to have a mystic significance.
   <p>My old friend and colleague, Campbell Dixon, used to tell of a
conversation he had with a New York film-critic, a lady, who heard
with an air of shocked incredulity that what he offered his public was
his own private and unsupported opinions. <quote>But surely,</quote> he said to
her, <quote>that's what you do, isn't it?</quote>
   <p><quote>Certainly not.</quote>
   <p><quote>Then what do you do?</quote>
   <p><quote>I stand in the foyer and listen to what people are saying.</quote>
   <p>Well, I'm not of this lady's persuasion. My opinions, such as
they are, are my own, formed in accordance with my own needs and
beliefs, my own experience. Nobody is likely, or even encouraged, to
agree with the opinions unless he has the same needs and beliefs. It
follows that a good number of the people who write to me about the
plays they are to see are appealing to one whose tastes and views they
do not share.
   <p>To take the simplest example possible, I get letters asking me to
select plays <quote>suitable for a family outing</quote> or <quote>suitable for
children</quote>. If I were to answer this according to my own beliefs, I
should probably say, ~<quote>Take your family (or your children) to
anything you think won't bore them</quote>; but it would be the wrong kind
of answer to anyone who thinks <quote>suitability</quote> all that important.
<head>Common Sense</head>
   <p>It is, to me, a matter of plain common sense. At any given
moment there are sure to be plays running in London to which the label
<quote>for adults only</quote> might with propriety be fixed. An actual label
is not necessary, because everybody knows which these plays are, or
can easily find out; and nobody in his senses would dream of taking a
child or an innocent maiden aunt (should such exist) to one of them.
Outside this category there are many plays of a mild degree of
unsuitability; and to these I personally should not hesitate to take
any member of my family.
   <p>When I was a young schoolboy I used to sneak off to the local
dust-hole week by week, and saw many plays of which my parents, if
consulted, might not have approved; and they never did me a mite of
harm. Later, when I myself was a parent, I exercised only the
lightest of censorship on my children's play-going, and they took no
harm either. How, then, can I help other people to impose a ban in
which I do not believe?
   <p>Anyway, once you begin to look at the problem, there is almost
nothing you can take a child to. Shakespeare is impossible, of
course &mdash; all those frank references to sex. And pantomime is worse.
Peter Pan? &mdash; very little sex there. True, but there are other
horrors. I remember sitting behind a small boy who bounced in his
chair with glee at the opening scene &mdash; the dog-nurse, the flying
lesson. But he fell oddly silent when the curtain rose, and when the
scene began to fill with wolves and Red Indians, pirates and
crocodiles he got off his seat, turned his back to the stage, and &mdash;
except for occasional terrified glances over his shoulder &mdash; spent the
rest of the act gazing longingly over my right shoulder at the
illuminated word EXIT.
   <p>It's just as difficult with adults. What can one do when asked
to recommend a play <quote>suitable</quote> for a party of 30 people (sex, age
and tastes all unspecified) except play safe and recommend <quote>My Fair
Lady</quote> or <quote>The Mouse-Trap</quote>?
   <p>To my mind, people do much better picking their own
entertainments, even at random. I know of a Women's Institute which,
on the strength of having enjoyed Sandy Wilson's pure <quote>Boy Friend,</quote>
went off blithely on an outing to Brighton to see his
hyper-sophisticated <quote>Valmouth.</quote>

<text id=LOBA18>
<head>Advise and condense</head>
<head>by W. J. Weatherby</head>
   <p>AT a recent Washington party a garrulous American egghead
tried to explain the difference between the Senate and the House of
Representatives to confused foreign visitors. But the more he tried
the more confused his audience looked &mdash; and at last, too deep into
references to populations, finance, and presidential recommendations,
he began to sound confused himself.
   <p>It was like a symbolical explanation of why so many outsiders
fail to understand American politics and why &mdash; to them &mdash; the
presidential leadership sometimes looks less decisive than it really
is. One of the best popular accounts of the complex system of checks
and balances in operation in Washington is Allen Drury's recent best
seller, <quote>Advise and Consent,</quote> and even that was too involved and
tortuous for some foreign readers. The decision then to make a
massive Hollywood production of Mr Drury's novel is like a challenge
to succeed where so many others have failed, for to be a success &mdash;
artistically as well as financially &mdash; the film will have to be true to
the reality of Washington and yet be simple enough for international
audiences to understand.
   <p>As the director, Otto Preminger, began to film recently in
Washington, our old friends Reality and Illusion were busy providing
some choice examples of their relationship in film terms. They met
head-on at one party when an actor playing a senator learnt that the
stranger he was chatting with was a real senator. The Hollywood
<quote>senator</quote> had a noble looking image &mdash; as public relations prose
sometimes puts it &mdash; and the gracious manners of an old plantation
patriarch, whereas the real senator had the kind of untypical and
unsaleable personality that might belong to a shopkeeper or a
millionaire and would not get heroic film billing anywhere outside a
home movie. The <quote>senator</quote> looked too right, almost as the outsider
might have expected him to look, whereas the real one had an
unexpectedness about him, as if he could not possibly be cast as
anyone but himself.
   <p>Much of the gap between Illusion and Reality is caused by the
problem of time. Mr Drury's President and senators who reveal
themselves gradually through 760 pages (at least in the American
paperback edition) have had to be transformed into Mr Preminger's
Franchot Tone, Don Murray, Lew Ayres, and the rest of an experienced
team who can make the most of their split-second timing to create
their characters in a matter of minutes. The real test of the film in
the end will be how much has had to be oversimplified or glossed over
to keep up with the clock.
   <p>Mr Drury chose a comparatively melodramatic incident &mdash; the
selection of a controversial Secretary of State and the conflict
between the White House and much of the Senate over it &mdash; and threw in
a few skeletons in the senatorial cupboards to show off when the
reader got too bogged down in the political manoeuvres. Mr Drury, a
former political reporter in Washington for the <quote>New York Times,</quote>
is a great believer in the moderates' way in politics, and his book in
one way is a tribute to his belief, in that it was moderate enough in
tone to be fair even to extremists like the arch conservative from the
South, Seab Cooley. Charles Laughton, who still has a Yorkshire ring
to his voice, described his preparation for playing Cooley as <quote>an
Eliza Doolittle job.</quote> He studied the right accent with a phonetics
expert and did some extra homework in conversation with some real
senators from the South. In the only scene I saw him play, he made
his point with lightning professional speed and also managed a
suggestion of an iceberg of character waiting to be revealed under the
surface. This was clearly how to make the most of the time and how
best to try to bridge the old Reality-Illusion gap.
   <p>Whether or not Mr Drury's moderate tone will be preserved in
the speed-up will depend very much on Mr Preminger, and if he loses
it, the ill-informed abroad may simply become the misinformed, with
Washington seeming a melodramatic circus rather than the complex
meeting-place of all the States, the focus of a nation's myriad
viewpoints. Mr Preminger's deep Austrian roots may help him there
for although now an American citizen, he may see Washington with both
an experienced eye and an objective one, which will enable him to find
its essence without getting lost in detail or disastrously
overglossing. His record suggests he is a believer in best-sellers as
a basis for a film, and a man who knows him suggests this is because
he usually becomes excited about one of the characters. This is
probably the former actor coming out in him, and certainly on the set
he often gives the impression of a caged actor on the wrong side of
the camera yearning to give a performance himself. This may explain
why sometimes his films let personality do the work of imagination and
perhaps why they are generally so well cast. In <quote>Advise and
Consent,</quote> for example, he has chosen a group of mature film actors &mdash;
men like Ayres, Tone, Fonda, Pidgeon, not to mention Laughton &mdash; who
could act most of the younger stars today off the screen.
   <p>The Preminger name seemed to be unlocking most doors in
Washington. How refreshing then it was for Reality to assert itself
in the person of a little tailor. One of Mr Preminger's assistants
went along to his shop to hire some tuxedos for the big banquet scene
and assumed he &mdash; or rather Mr Preminger &mdash; would naturally be given
credit. The Preminger name worked no miracles with the little man (he
was only little physically) and he threw in for good measure that he
would need cash even if the President of the United States came in to
hire a tuxedo. His image wasn't smooth or glossy or predictable, but,
oh, my goodness, he was alive. If only all those foreign outsiders
could grasp he is more typical of Americans than any of the
politicians (even President Kennedy) or any of the film stars (even
<quote>President</quote> Tone), perhaps Reality would win after all.
<head>FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI</head>
<head>by Gareth Lloyd Evans</head>
   <p>FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI, whose explosive production of <quote>Romeo
and Juliet</quote> shook the Old Vic out of its Shakespearean sloth, is now
at Stratford on Avon setting the fuses for <quote>Othello,</quote> which opens
next week. Yet, in spite of what we saw at the Old Vic, our
expectations for <quote>Othello,</quote> and his very name (like a hissing
firework) he only occasionally fulfils prognostications of a mercurial
Italian. Without his long leather black jacket (redolent of
Florentine back-street conspiracy) he could be mistaken for a tired
young English director uniformed in the easy darkness of black slacks,
black sneakers, and dull pullover. His accent is slight, his voice
even-toned, his gestures spare. The eyes are restless, but sometimes
pause on you with disconcerting acuteness. He slips into first
acquaintance easily, and smokes Salems like a furnace.
   <p>From his <quote>Romeo and Juliet</quote> one might expect a vivid staccato
modern with the customary irreverence for tradition, but the great
surprise is his imaginative, eloquent <quote>feel</quote> for historical
process, and his sense of Western civilisation as an entity. He seems
to feel his own presence in England now as a reflection of an
historical logic which made sixteenth-century England the natural heir
of the Florentine renaissance &mdash; this is not conceit, but an implied
affirmation of the staying power of cultural unity. Florence was the
starting-point of Western culture, and for him personally. He studied
architecture there and began his theatre work directing opera in
Siena. He mentions other Italian cities ~(<quote>The Romans were the
whores of Western civilisation</quote>) but Florence penetrates his
conversation.
   <p>
   <p>IT is easy, say, for a Florentine to accept foreigners, but
they do not usually see the reality behind the fa&ccedil;ade of Tuscan
easy-going optimism. It hides a preoccupation with death, a
questioning of what life means, and a practical attitude towards art.
For Zeffirelli, the genius of the Florentine renaissance lies in its
workmanship &mdash; <quote>The Tuscans do not believe in fairy tales.</quote>
Shakespeare, he knows, could never have been in Italy, or he would
have realised all this. <quote>Romeo and Juliet</quote> is very un-Italian &mdash;
<quote>There are many English girls like Juliet. An Italian girl would
never dare to do what she did &mdash; they are too practical.</quote> But <quote>As
You Like It</quote> is very Florentine, and full of a workmanlike
questioning. As he said this he gouged a geometrical pattern on the
posh tablecloth of the theatre restaurant. He believes himself to be
a typical Florentine.
   <p>A limited stake in the Bard might be inferred from the fact that
he has directed, in England, two of Shakespeare's <quote>Mediterranean</quote>
plays. He firmly repudiates this. He will probably direct
<quote>Hamlet</quote> soon. This should be an event worth waiting for. His
approach to a play is to discover <quote>one simple idea, the creative
idea, like a poet.</quote> The idea for <quote>Romeo and Juliet</quote> was the
irresponsibility of young love pushed into tragedy by Shakespeare.
<quote>Othello</quote> is the <quote>sentimental</quote> tragedy of a cultivated, brave
man who comes to love too late, and does not know what to do with it.
<quote>It is a tragedy not to know what to do with love.</quote>
Zeffirelli does not mention the colour of Othello's skin, but his
knife traced another geometrical pattern. He gets an idea, and must
stick to it. In the face of this, I tempted disaster by raising the
bogy of cutting Shakespeare, and scholarly interpretation. The former
he shrugged away, and I assumed that, for him, the <quote>idea</quote> justifies
the means. With the latter he toyed for an instant, then, his smile
tightening into patience, he gave the benefice of the preservation of
a tradition to the scholar.
   <p>
   <p>IN spite of his apparently complete immersion in theatre,
there is a paradox in his character. He seems unhappy inside the core
of his response to all that art means in terms of beauty, vitality,
and work. He complained that he is always surrounded by theatre
people, but one suspects that he would wither away if taken away for
too long. It may be that his ubiquitous talent (he supervises costume
down to the last buttonhole) exhausts him. It may be that he is
typically Florentine, fighting death along the theatre's shore-line of
make-believe. One's guess is that the war (he was a partisan) left
him immeasurably fearful of what man can do to man.
   <p>He spoke bitterly of Germany. The only Brecht play he would
consider directing is <quote>Mother Courage.</quote> <quote>Alienation</quote> is
contrary to all his beliefs about art and men, but there is more to it
than this. <quote>Brecht is the Wagner of modern Germany. Germany has
done terrible things to the soul of man.</quote> Perhaps it is
sympathetic fear which prompts his friendliness to other people. He
is at home with scene-shifters, ASMs, and strangers who stop to
ask about his high-powered sports car. He thinks of a theatre in
terms of a family. In so far as he can be content, he is so in the
British Theatre. <quote>You have the best theatre in the world, the best
actors, the best audiences.</quote> Under pressure he admits some
Stratford audiences seemed dead, but ~<quote>English audiences are the
best... English people live in a pattern, and theatre-going is part
of that pattern.</quote> He admires English actors for their discipline,
<quote>but they have weaknesses.</quote> What they were he did not say,
except obscurely to declare that you cannot separate the artistic and
personal life.
   <p>When the conversation turned away from Shakespeare, from the
unequivocally great in the art or the intensely human, Zeffirelli's
mind seemed to drop several degrees in temperature. Yes, he knew
about Wesker and Delaney; yes, they seemed powerful, but all report.
The trouble was that they were too late, old-fashioned. All this
naturalism, he says, has been done such a long time ago in France and
elsewhere. But, implying and mitigating their weakness in one breath,
he added that perhaps at the beginning of any movement you had to have
<quote>roughness, where things have to be hacked out, until everything
runs smoothly.</quote>

<head>THE WELL-BRED SNEERS THAT WOULD STIFLE TALENT...</head>
<head>by BERNARD LEVIN</head>
   <p>LONG, long ago, Mr. Noel Coward wrote an autobiography
called <quote>Present Indicative.</quote>
   <p>In Part Five he is invited to a house-party, where he meets some
of the bright young people of the time.
   <p><squote>Their shirts and flannels were yellow and well used against
which mine seemed too newly white, too immaculately moulded from
musical comedy. Their socks, thick and carelessly wrinkled round
their ankles, so unlike mine of too thin silk, caught up by intricate
suspenders.
   <p>Their conversation, too, struck a traditional note in my ears. I
seemed to know what they were going to say long before they said it.
I sensed in their fledgling jokes and light, unsubtle badinage a
certain quality of youthfulness that I had never known. And although
I was the same age, if not younger than many of them, I felt suddenly
old, over-experienced and quite definitely out of the picture.</squote>
<head>No change</head>
   <p>THAT was in 1922, and Mr. Coward hasn't changed a bit. For
this last couple of weeks he has been shooting off his predictably
pursed mouth on the British theatre of today, in the Sunday Times.
   <p>And Mr. Coward is still obsessed by the immensely important
fact that other people do not dress exactly as he does.
   <p>He still feels old and over-experienced. He still has the air of
resentful superiority to more successful people. And he is still
terribly, terribly, definitely out of the picture.
   <p>In fact, the only advance &mdash; and that a slight one &mdash; is that he
seems to have stopped writing sentences with no verbs in them.
   <p>Now a man who was too old in 1922 can hardly be expected to have
much idea of what is going on in 1961. And from Mr. Coward's
petulant, bewildered, inaccurate, and shabby attack on the playwrights
and players of today anyone foolish enough to trust him as a guide to
the current theatrical scene would get a quite lunatic idea of what
was going on in it.
<head>Success</head>
   <p>THEY would not learn, for instance, that our stages are
fuller of good stuff, and our auditoriums of enthusiastic audiences,
than for many years.
   <p>They would have no idea that the current British theatrical
renaissance is having an effect far beyond the West End of London, so
that Broadway is heavily influenced by the highly successful plays of
today that it has imported from Britain.
   <p>They would never discover that our writers and players are
exciting as well as excited, that they speak in tones of passion and
belief and deep, proud faith. They would not be told that the
technical accomplishment displayed by some of these members of our New
Wave is astonishing in its range and completeness.
   <p>Above all, they would never, never know that the New Wave &mdash; and
it is the one thing that Mr. Coward can no more forgive than he can
understand &mdash; is supremely successful, or that his own latest offering
to Britain's ungrateful stage (<quote>Waiting in the Wings</quote>) is being
withdrawn shortly, having failed, as they say in the profession, to
attract an audience.
<head>So nice</head>
   <p>YET it is Mr. Coward &mdash; too old nearly 40 years ago, mark
you &mdash; who offers himself as the man to lead the poor, stumbling
audiences out of the theatrical dark and into the bright, brave
noonday where it is always perfect anyone-for-tennis weather, and
where nothing as vulgar and squalid as a stove is ever mentioned, but
where lots of nice, jolly, fun-giving adultery &mdash; to the immense,
brittle amusement of The Master &mdash; is.
   <p>I think it is time that the case for the British theatre of today
was made, and made loud and clear. Hitherto it has had nothing but
its talent and its success to speak for it against the well-bred
sneers (getting a little tight around the jaw-muscles by now) of those
whom the New Wave has been washing higher and drier up the beach.
   <p>It is ridiculous, to begin with, to speak in the same breath of
such vastly diverse talents and outlooks as those of John Osborne,
Robert Bolt, Arnold Wesker, John Mortimer, Shelagh Delaney, John
Arden, N. F. Simpson, Harold Pinter, Lionel Bart, Peter Shaffer,
Willis Hall. They write about a gigantic range of different people,
classes, and situations.
   <p>Mr. Bolt in <quote>A Man for All Seasons,</quote> took us to the Court of
Henry 8, and in <quote>The Tiger and the Horse</quote> to an Oxford college.
   <p>In the one, a dark, rich portrait of a saint wrestling with his
conscience; in the other, an agonisingly brilliant study of a half-man
who grows whole under the impact of tragedy.
<head>Exquisite</head>
   <p>MR. WESKER, in his exquisite trilogy, ranges from the
pre-war East End of London to the post-war Norfolk, from the
semi-literate old Jewish immigrants to the intense and musical young
Ronnie, from the dying of the old to the rebirth of the young.
   <p>Mr. Shaffer, in his mercilessly observed <quote>Five Finger
Exercise,</quote> and Mr. Mortimer, in his <quote>The Wrong Side of the
Park,</quote> explored the hearts of characters middle-class enough to
satisfy even Mr. Coward.
   <p>From Mr. Mortimer and Mr. Simpson we have come to expect wit,
style and elegance &mdash; three things that the false prophets of decay try
to tell us have disappeared from our stages. And Mr. Simpson's
lunatic logic has a freshness, a lightness about it that would make
<quote>Waiting in the Wings</quote> seem bad even if it weren't.
   <p>From Miss Delaney we get the authentic accents of the young; and
from Mr. Bart we get a large number of very good tunes, which some
more traditional quarters have found hard to come by lately. In
short, from them all we get a huge, bursting cornucopia of every kind
of writing, every kind of plot, every kind of setting, every kind of
character.
<head>Belief</head>
   <p>AND to all this theatrical richness, the poor darling dodos
can only squeak <quote>kitchen sink</quote> and <quote>dustbin</quote> drama. In fact,
only one play in the last few years has had a dustbin in it, and that
was by an Irishman who writes in French. Only one has a kitchen sink
in it, and that one &mdash; Mr. Wesker's &mdash; was the one which above all
proclaimed its faith in beauty, goodness, and truth, and turned
savagely to rend squalor and those who perpetuate it.
   <p>Which brings me to what I think is the clue &mdash; the common factor
shared by many of our younger playwrights, and the element which above
all produces uncomprehending rage in Mr. Coward.
   <p>In a single word, it is Belief.
<head>Poets without Appointments</head>
<head>by PETER CHAMBERS</head>
   <p>AT the top of 14 uncarpeted stairs in a Notting Hill mews
lives Christopher Logue, poet. <quote>Come up and have a drink,</quote> he
yelled out of the window. I went up and lay down.
   <p>This was obligatory, because Logue owns one typewriter, 500
books, and almost no furniture. I lay on the bed. Logue lay on the
floor. The only chair in the room was occupied by Burns Singer, a
Scottish poet who chain-smoked cigarettes made out of loose tobacco,
and remarked from time to time: <quote>Do ye not find the whisky in
London terrible?</quote>
   <p>Nobody seems to care about any modern poet nowadays except John
Betjeman, who writes agreeably in praise of buttered toast and railway
stations, and became a best seller almost By Appointment after
Princess Margaret said she liked his verse.
   <p>But what are the other fellows up to? How do they live? I got
some interesting answers from Logue and Singer, and later from an
American, Theodore Roethke, who has actually made poetry pay.
<head>Money</head>
   <p>CHRISTOPHER LOGUE is a dark, narrow, energetic man of 34. If
he were an actor, I would type-cast him as Shakespeare's Iago.
   <p>He has published half a dozen books of poetry and achieved a
wider reputation when he wrote the lyrics for the Royal Court Theatre
musical <quote>The Lily-White Boys.</quote>
   <p><quote>I actually made quite good money then,</quote> said Logue. <quote>For
the eight weeks the show ran I earned &pound;85 a week. But that
represented six months' work, don't forget. Average it out and you
see I was really getting less than a waiter.</quote>
<head>Noisy</head>
   <p>A CURRENT book of poetry, <quote>Songs,</quote> has earned Logue &pound;100.
He was paid exactly that for one article in the American teenage
magazine Mademoiselle.
   <p>Christopher Logue writes fierce, noisy poems about war, love, and
Logue. Son of a Southampton civil servant, he was brought up by
Jesuits.
   <p><quote>I now believe in the total abolition of private property,</quote> he
said.
   <p>He got up off the floor, rattled some coal into the stove, and
lay down again.
   <p>A gleam of gold shone in the front teeth of Burns Singer as he
lit his fifth home-made cigarette. He said: <quote>Of course, Christopher
believes that propoganda and politics are part of poetry.
   <p><quote>For me, it's different. It's almost like psychoanalysis. I'll
do no work for weeks and then write solidly for 12 hours. I think
what I'm really seeking all the time is the source of Original Sin in
myself.</quote>
   <p>Logue leaped to his feet at this heresy and shouted: <quote>Original
Sin! What are you talking about?</quote>
   <p>Logue looks like a man who would punch anybody on the nose. But
then who could punch Burns Singer? A mass of gold hair frames his
face, he has the air of a spiritualised Viking whom the bigger men
left at home when they set out in their long-prowed ships to raid
England.
<head>Flames</head>
   <p><quote>JIMMY</quote> to his friends, Burns Singer is actually the son
of a Glaswegian mother and a Jewish salesman from Manchester. I count
him the most inflammable poet on the English scene, because the way he
showers burning tobacco strands on his flossy gold beard he is bound
to go up in flames one day.
   <p>In love, he wrote: &mdash;
<quote>
   <p>I cannot see
   <p>Smiles in another.
   <p>And every tear
   <p>I brush aside
   <p>I find you hidden within it
   <p>like a bride
<QUOTE/>
   <p>He wrote that for Marie, the woman he made his bride five years
ago. She is a New York-born Negress with a Harley-street practice in
psychotherapy.
   <p>Dreamers only part of the time, poets show an acute interest in
money, mainly because of the difficulty they have in laying their
hands on it.
   <p>Most magazines pay &pound;10 10s. for a short poem, and the rates at
the B.B.C. go down to 10d. a line for longer broadcast works.
Poets write reviews and do journalism to make a living.
   <p><quote>I'm never sloppy about money,</quote> said Christopher Logue in a
raging voice. <quote>I want a car. I want to eat out in restaurants. You
know who I'd like to be? I'd like to be president of U.S.
Steel!</quote>
   <p>Burns Singer, once a fish-chasing zoologist at Aberdeen Marine
Laboratory, said: <quote>I'd like to be Spyros K. Skouras. I just fancy
the glamour of working in films.</quote>
<head>Professor</head>
   <p>THE world does not owe poets a living, but it pays more than
a modest competence to Theodore Roethke (pronounced ret-key), a
great shambling American poet big as a house and earning enough money
to live in one in smart Belgravia during his London visit.
   <p>Dwarfing a glass of sherry with his big hand, 52-year-old Roethke
told me: <quote>My great year was 1958, when I picked up &pound;10,000 in
various prizes, including an award from the Ford Foundation.
   <p><quote>As a working Professor of English at the University of
Washington, Seattle, I teach poetry for &pound;4,500 a year.</quote>
   <p>But the amount he gets by actually writing poetry and getting it
published is only about &pound;1,000 a year.
<head>Journey</head>
   <p>ROETHKE'S best man when he married, was W. H. Auden, who
sang his songs for more than sixpence as the best-known British poet
of the 1930s. <quote>But even Auden can't make a living just writing
poetry,</quote> said Roethke. <quote>I doubt if anybody does, except maybe
Robert Frost.</quote>
   <p>Let's face it, poems will never be as popular as football
coupons, and what America offers is just bigger subsidies.
   <p>As characters, poets range from rhyming layabouts to saintly
travellers who have embarked on the greatest journey of all: the
journey into the mind and spirit of man.

<head>ARMY RESERVE TO BE STRENGTHENED</head>
<head>Statement to M.P.s This Week:</head>
<head>B.A.O.R. Will Get Key Men</head>
<head>SMALL CALL-UP POSSIBLE</head>
<head>BY OUR MILITARY REPORTER</head>
   <p>PLANS for strengthening Britain's strategic reserve
division will be announced by Mr Watkinson, Minister of Defence, in
the Commons this week. Some units have been recently redeployed to
form a division for service in Germany should the situation there
continue to deteriorate.
   <p>No indication has been given of what this increase will be, or
where the troops will be found. While conscription can be ruled out,
it may be that some limited numbers of reserve units may be affected.
Steps have been taken to meet some key deficiencies in B.A.O.R.
by transferring about 100 ancillary troops from overseas.
   <p>As B.A.O.R. is short of specialists it is likely that the
strategic reserve division in Britain is also deficient, and to bring
it to full strength it is unlikely that further depletion of overseas
garrisons can be countenanced.
<head>AMERICAN CRITICISM</head>
   <p>How far Britain's moves to strengthen her reserves will meet
American criticism remains to be seen. But it is unlikely that
America's plan for a three-stage defence structure will be followed.
   <p>Under this plan Washington aims to meet an initial enemy
conventional onslaught with conventional weapons. If these fail
tactical nuclear weapons will be used, and finally strategic nuclear
weapons.
   <p>But the British defence policy, as laid down in the 1957 Sandys
Plan, is showing signs of wobbling. Defence spokesmen now qualify the
statement that nuclear retaliation would be used in any major Russian
aggression by saying that the use of nuclear weapons would depend on
the circumstances, strength and area of the attack.
   <p>Privately, some defence officials go even further and say that
the original Sandys policy is <quote>dead as a dodo.</quote>
<head>\DE GAULLE WILL SEE PREMIER ON BERLIN</head>
<head>BY GORDON BROOK-SHEPHERD</head>
<head>Sunday Telegraph Diplomatic Correspondent</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT and Madame \de Gaulle will pay a private visit to
Britain from Nov. 24 to 26 as guests of Mr Macmillan and his wife.
A French statement on the visit said both leaders felt the time had
come for <quote>a frank exchange of views on the international situation
and especially about the tactics to be adopted towards easing tension
with Russia.</quote>
   <p>It is believed in London that nearly all the weekend visit will
be devoted to what one British official described as <quote>quiet and
intense business talks.</quote>
   <p>I understand the main purpose of the meeting will be to plot an
agreed Western approach to the Berlin and German issues. At present
the West is moving forward in a sort of ragged Indian file with the
French almost out of contact in the rear.
<head>Concession Made</head>
   <p>In the last few days General \de Gaulle is reported to have won
what amounts to an important concession from his allies. A major
policy switch has been tentatively agreed between the British,
Americans and West Germans which partly reflects the French line of
remaining <quote>tough</quote> with Mr Khruschev.
   <p>It is understood that the British and American envoys in Moscow
have been empowered if necessary to seek an emergency standstill
agreement with the Russians on the Berlin situation alone as a first
step to broader negotiations. This could be informal in the sense
that no document need be signed.
<head>Short-term Basis</head>
   <p>It could be reached at ambassadorial level, taking the form of
an East-West declaration re-affirming Allied rights and
responsibilities in Berlin, if only on a short-term basis. The
purpose would be to remove the fuse from the Berlin bomb.
   <p>This approach would represent a complete change of strategy from
that favoured in the talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr.
Gromyko, less than a month ago. Then the Anglo-American emphasis was
on seeking a broader agenda to avoid a debate on the vulnerable
question of Berlin alone.
   <p>French and West German fears that such a broader agenda would
involve the West in dangerous concessions have contributed to the
latest change. So has the mounting tension in Berlin.
   <p>The West now seems to have adopted Mr. Khruschev's famous
<quote>salami</quote> tactics in trying to solve the problem slice by slice. If
a short term stabilisation agreement can be reached on Berlin in the
next few weeks the problem of increasing contacts between East and
West Germany could be tackled as a separate step.
   <p>The final phase would be a formal top level agreement.
   <p>The possibility is not ruled out in London that Mr. Khruschev
may try to exploit President Kennedy's impatience with Western
differences of opinion. This he would do by trying to bargain direct
with Washington.
<head>Private Contacts</head>
   <p>As part of this campaign an invitation may well be sent to the
American Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, to visit Moscow.
   <p>The Russians are thought to have been encouraged along these
lines by the progress made in New York towards solving the United
Nations crisis through repeated private contacts between the Soviet
and American chief delegates there, Mr. Zorin and Mr. Stevenson.
<head>RUSSIA AND CHINA IN STRUGGLE FOR AFRICA</head>
<head>BY OUR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT</head>
   <p>NEW evidence has reached London of the struggle between the
Russians and the Chinese to dominate the mind of Africa. It
illustrates that global rivalry between Peking and Moscow, of which
the current dispute over Albania is only the symbol.
   <p>In at least one of the new African states, Somalia, the two
Communist powers have begun to clash head-on. The Russians, who have
built up a huge Embassy with a staff of nearly 300 in Mogadishu, the
capital, support the established Government.
   <p>The Chinese operate through a smaller mission, but have a New
China News Agency in addition, whereas the Russians have no Tass
representation. The Chinese policy is one of outright support for the
dissident opposition groups, including the extremist Pan-Somali
Movement.
   <p>This aims at uniting all Somalis, including those in neighbouring
Kenya and Ethiopia, under one rule.
   <p>Chinese support takes the form of secret money subsidies, and the
inviting of Somali dissidents to Peking. Here some of them are said
to have been given guerrilla training, on the pattern recently
reported for candidates from the Cameroun Republic.
<head>Moscow Concern</head>
   <p>Russian disavowal of the Pan-Somalis is partly based on
Moscow's concern for good relations with Ethiopia, where a major
Soviet effort is being made. But the issue is also a basic
ideological one.
   <p>Throughout Africa, the Chinese are putting forward their militant
brand of Communism as the true model for the new black states and are
openly decrying the more moderate Soviet line.
   <p>To support this campaign, the Chinese have developed a radio
propaganda barrage nearly twice as heavy as the Russian effort.
Peking Radio now has a total output of 91 hours a week broadcasting
to Africa. This is far more than any other station in the world and
compares with the Soviet Union's tally of 54 1/2 hours a week.
   <p>Seven different Chinese agencies have been identified running
operations inside Africa itself. All have been founded in the last 18
months and three sprang into life this year.
<head>The Difference</head>
   <p>They operate along unorthodox but highly effective lines.
Whereas the Russians keep mainly to standard cultural missions and
student training schemes, the Chinese get down to jungle roots.
   <p>They are covering the dark continent with troupes of acrobats,
dancers and jugglers who travel from village to village. Needless to
say the jugglers start spinning Marxist slogans as soon as they have
finished their advertised act.
   <p>The Somali pattern of more or less open conflict is repeated in
Guinea. The other main centres of Chinese penetration are the Cote
\d'Ivoire, Zanzibar and Mozambique.
   <p>A major Chinese agitation is predicted by Western observers soon
among the black population of South Africa. This would give Peking a
hold on the tip of the continent, as well as at strategic points up
both the East and the West coasts.
<head>Soviet Tanks <quote>Out-Faced</quote> by Americans</head>
<head>From REGINALD PECK</head>
<head>Sunday Telegraph Special Correspondent</head>
<head>BERLIN, Saturday.</head>
   <p>THE withdrawal of Russian and American tanks from the
Friedrichstrasse crossing point today brought some relaxation of
tension in Berlin. But the opposing tanks remained within a mile of
each other.
   <p>First to back down in the war of nerves were the Russians, and as
their T-34 tanks rumbled away an American official was heard to say:
<quote>We seem to have faced the Russian Ivan.</quote> About 90 minutes later
the 10 American tanks retired.
   <p>The Americans have now stated that they intend for the time being
to give up their practice of enforcing their right of uncontrolled
access to East Berlin by sending officials through the
Friedrichstrasse checkpoint with armed escorts. They say, <quote>our point
has now been made.</quote>
<head>U.S. plane's defiance</head>
   <p>Less than half an hour after the American tanks had withdrawn,
a United States Air Force C-47 defied a Russian protest against
overflying East Berlin. It circled for about ten minutes at about 600
feet over an area where 40 Russian tanks were parked.
   <p>Col. Soloviev, the Russian Commandant in Berlin last night sent
two letters to the American Commandant, one of which protested against
United States helicopters flying over East Berlin. The American
mission in Berlin today said their planes have every right to fly over
all of the city.
   <p>Up to this morning it had seemed that the dangerous situation
that built up suddenly at dusk last night when the Russian tanks
arrived might continue indefinitely. Angry West Berliners twice
mobbed Russian cars, booing and kicking the vehicles.
   <p>Before the departure of the Russian tanks the East German
Communists staged a propaganda demonstration by sending youths and
girls to present the crews with flowers and chocolates. Earlier, West
Berlin civilians had taken flowers to the crews of the two foremost
American tanks.
   <p>It had been reported that more Russian tanks have reached East
Berlin. I drove through the Eastern sector but saw nothing more than
military jeeps outside the ruins of the Prinzenpalais in Unter \den
Linden, where the first Russian tanks were based 48 hours ago.
   <p>At <quote>checkpoint Charlie</quote> my passport was examined by Communist
guards and I was asked if I was carrying East German money, coffee or
cocoa. The only civilian in sight was a grey-haired woman who said
she had lost her way but gave the impression she had hoped to slip
through to the West.
<head>MR. BROWN <quote>WORRIED</quote> BY B.A.O.R.</head>
<head>SUNDAY TELEGRAPH REPORTER</head>
   <p>MR. GEORGE BROWN, the Labour Party's spokesman on
defence, arrived at London Airport yesterday after a four-day
inspection of the British Army of the Rhine. He said he was more
worried after his visit than before.
   <p>Although no units were dangerously undermanned, the Army was a
few thousand short of its peacetime establishment and well below the
strength that would be needed in war. There was a particular shortage
of men in medical units.
   <p>In equipment there was a shortage of radios, some arms and
armoured personnel carriers.
   <p>Britain's commitment in Europe should be given top priority.
Other overseas commitments, particularly in the Far East, should be
re-examined to see if such large numbers of men need be tied down.
Conscription was not the answer to the need for men.
   <p>Asked if Britain was capable of fulfilling its role in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, he replied: <quote>We are as well able to do
it as anyone else.
   <p><quote>The men are well trained and well deployed. But it is the role
of the whole N.A.T.O. army that worries me and our role in that.
   <p><quote>While I am clear myself on what that role is, I am not sure
whether the politicians' statements are clear to the military generals
and to Air Force chiefs.</quote>
<head>DORNIERS FOR NEW KATANGA AIR FORCE</head>
<head>FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>ELIZABETHVILLE, SATURDAY.</head>
   <p>FIVE twin-engined German Dorniers for the new Air Force
which President Tshombe is forming, have been delivered to
Elizabethville. They are the first of nearly 50 planes which have
been ordered to strengthen Katanga's defences.
   <p>I flew here from Munich in one of the planes after meeting the
pilots, two British, one Belgian and two French.

<head>BOMBERS RACING TO KUWAIT</head>
<head>More troops ready to go</head>
<head>NEWS OF THE WORLD DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT</head>
   <p>MORE British troops, aircraft and warships are racing to
Kuwait this morning from Germany, Cyprus, Kenya and even the Far East.
The British military authorities describe the operation as <quote>a very
rapid build-up.</quote>
   <p>In New York the Security Council is meeting at 11 a.m.
today at the special request of both Britain and Kuwait. And in
Washington the State Department of the United States has endorsed
Britain's show of force, expressing the hope that it will help to
assure the preservation of peace.
   <p>In London yesterday, as the first British troops and aircraft
went in and Royal Navy warships circled in the off-shore Gulf
heat-haze Mr. Macmillan called an emergency meeting of Cabinet
Ministers and Service Chiefs. Mr. Hugh Gaitskell, Leader of the
Opposition, went to Admiralty House to hear the inside story of the
situation from the Premier.
   <p>Then last night at Bowood, Calne, Wilts, the Premier,
speaking to the Wessex area Conservative Rally, explained what the
Government is doing about the threat by Premier Kassem of Iraq to
annexe Kuwait &mdash; and why.
   <p><quote>I still trust that threats against Kuwait are no more than
words and that the Government of Iraq will refrain from any aggressive
action,</quote> he said.
   <p>But he added, <quote>We must take no risk and in view of the language
that is being used and the indications of a military build-up which
may threaten Kuwait, we have thought it right to respond to the urgent
and formal request which the ruler has made to us that we should give
him some protectionary strength.</quote>
<head>TANKS</head>
   <p>Mr. Gaitskell, speaking at Bristol, said he could not see how
Britain could have refused to help Kuwait. But our troops should not
stay there a day longer than necessary. The United Nations should be
asked to put in a force to replace them as soon as possible.
   <p>The first British troops in, about 600 Royal Marines of 42
Commando and 150 men of the Third Dragoon Guards with 14 Centurion
tanks, went ashore at Kuwait in a shade temperature of 120 degrees.
   <p>The Marines had come racing up the searingly hot Persian Gulf
in the Royal Navy carrier Bulwark, which set out from Karachi on
Thursday.
   <p>And the Dragoon Guards were put ashore from the tank landing
ship Striker, which arrived with an amphibious warfare squadron.
   <p>Almost simultaneously a squadron of R.A.F. Hawker Hunter jet
fighters came screaming in for a landing. They are believed to have
flown from Kenya.
   <p>Off-shore, meanwhile, the British frigate Loch Alvie and the
vessels of the amphibious warfare squadron circled before anchoring,
apparently just outside the three-mile limit.
<head>ALERTED</head>
   <p>Soon afterwards it was announced in Kuwait that an unknown
number of Saudi Arabian troops had also arrived. And that eight
R.A.F. Canberra jet bombers from Germany had reached the Persian
Gulf air base at Sharjah.
   <p>Two squadrons of Canberra bombers from Cyprus were reported to
have arrived at Aden on their way to Kuwait.
   <p>Men of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiments and the 2nd
Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Cyprus were said to have been
alerted for a move.
   <p>And from Kenya there were reports that the men of the
Coldstream Guards and King's Regiment were soon ready to be airlifted
North as soon as aircraft became available.
   <p>In Kuwait plans were being made to evacuate the 3,000 or so
Britons who live there. But it was stated officially that there are
no thoughts of evacuation unless the situation deteriorates seriously.
   <p>And the Kuwait Supreme Council announced that the frontier with
Iraq had been closed.
<head>Terms before we join Common Market</head>
   <p>BRITAIN has made it quite clear that she must make conditions
before joining the Common Market <quote>in its present form,</quote> said Mr.
R. A. Butler yesterday.
   <p><quote>We are determined to safeguard the interests of our farmers,
our Commonwealth partners and our friends in the European Free Trade
Association,</quote> he told Conservatives at Harrogate.
   <p>Mr. Butler, who was speaking as Chairman of the Conservative
Party, said no decision had yet been reached even to enter into formal
negotiations for joining.
   <p>If we reached some agreement there would have to be major
changes, he said. He warned that industry would have to face more
competition from European goods.
   <p>A paper published yesterday by the non-Party P.E.P.
(Political and Economic Planning) says most British farmers will not
be adversely affected if Britain joins the Market.
   <p>Some farmers might gain. But horticulturists <quote>would have to
meet keener competition unless imports were restricted by some other
means than tariffs.</quote>
   <p>The National Farmers' Union said the P.E.P. study did not
show that farmers would be as well-off on a long-term basis under
Common Market terms.
<head>NOW KRUSCHEV HOTS UP THE BERLIN CRISIS</head>
<head>From A. NOYES THOMAS</head>
<head>WEST BERLIN, Saturday.</head>
   <p>MR. KRUSCHEV today made two ominous moves &mdash; and another
threatening statement &mdash; on the heightening German crisis. He
suspended all planned reductions in Soviet armed forces. He
stepped-up Soviet military expenditure by more than 30 per cent. And
he said: &mdash;
   <p><quote>We shall sign a peace treaty with East Germany and order our
armed forces to administer a worthy rebuff to any aggressor if he
raises his hand against the Soviet Union or our friends.
   <p><quote>It is best for those who think of war not to imagine that
distance will save them&hellip;.. We have everything at our disposal to
solve successfully the responsible tasks facing us.</quote>
   <p>The speech, broadcast by Moscow radio, coincided with a meeting
on the Berlin and German problem between President Kennedy and his top
advisers.
<head>Razor edge</head>
   <p>And while the Soviet leader was talking the Nato Council in
Paris received from Washington the text of a Note which the United
States Government will shortly deliver to the Kremlin.
   <p>The contents of the Note, which is in reply to one handed to
President Kennedy in Vienna on June 4, are not known. But it is
believed to reject Mr. Kruschev's demands.
   <p>As the news pours in from around the world, beleagured 
Berlin this weekend is a city on a razor's edge.
   <p>Until 24 hours or so ago West Berliners, who have been building
up vast stocks of food against the possibility of another siege of
their city, believed the West was determined to stand fast in the face
of all Communist threats.
   <p>But then from Washington came seemingly authoritative reports
that the Americans might not be prepared to risk war on these issues
after all.
   <p>From this distance it appears that the United States Government
is ready to accept East German control of the West's tenuous
life-lines through the Communist Zone to the isolated city.
   <p>I have just had a long talk with the man at the centre of the
crisis, Herr Willy Brandt, Mayor of West Berlin and a strong candidate
for the Chancellorship of Western Germany.
   <p>Kruschev, he believes, has become <quote>a prisoner of his own
words.</quote> After years of bluffing over East Germany and West Berlin
the Soviet leader is faced at last with the necessity of doing
something about it, whether he likes it or not.
   <p>One reason: to satisfy the impatient leaders of impoverished,
struggling East Germany who, says Herr Brandt, in many respects tend
to be more Russian than the Russians.
   <p>Herr Brandt has no doubt whatsoever that Mr. Kruschev really
does intend this time to make a separate peace treaty with East
Germany.
   <p>Privately, though, Herr Brandt is not at all convinced that the
Russians see eye to eye with the East Germans over a change in the
status of West Berlin.
   <p>This in spite of the fact that Soviet propaganda frequently
refers to the present set-up as <quote>a thorn in the flesh,</quote> <quote>a bone in
the throat</quote> and <quote>a base for hostile, provocative activity.</quote>
   <p><quote>Look at it this way,</quote> says the young handsome mayor <quote>Every
week between 4,000 and 5,000 East Germans escape into West Germany,
many of them through West Berlin.
   <p><quote>Every day crowds of East Berliners come into West Berlin to
goggle at the prosperity here before returning to their own drab side
of the city where, 16 years after the war, meat and butter are still
rationed.
   <p><quote>All this is galling to the East German authorities, but the
Russians, I suspect, see West Berlin as a safety valve. It calms the
feelings of many in East Germany to know that their symbol of freedom
is here, close by; to know that there is a way out.
   <p><quote>Remove that safety valve and things might begin to happen in
East Germany. Not a revolution, maybe. But sabotage, more go-slow
campaigns, all kinds of passive resistance.</quote>
   <p>Herr Brandt believes that until now the Russians have actually
vetoed East German plans to stop the flow of refugees.
   <p>Today Gerhard Eiseler, the East German propaganda chief, made a
speech hinting at a new war of nerves against West Berlin.
   <p>Says Herr Brandt: <quote>If it comes it may be far less dramatic,
though no less dangerous, than most people expect.</quote>
   <p>He cannot see it taking as blunt a turn as a new blockade on the
scale of the last one.
<head>COME ON BRITAIN!</head>
<head>By The Chancellor</head>
<head>We've got to pull up our socks</head>
<head>BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</head>
   <p>GRIM-FACED and speaking with quiet emphasis, Mr. Selwyn
Lloyd gave the country a tough pep talk yesterday. Come on, Britain,
we've got to pull up our socks &mdash; that was the burden of his fighting
speech in which he announced that he will tell the House of Commons on
Tuesday week the means he proposes to take to get Britain out of the
red.
   <p>He added that on this <quote>Little Budget Day</quote> he will recommend
<quote>such action as I think necessary, however unpopular or
unexpected.</quote>
   <p><quote>I am not afraid,</quote> he said, <quote>to ask the British people to
bear the necessary burdens or accept the necessary disciplines
designed to secure not just the survival but also the maintenance of
our position as an up-to-date, progressive, dynamic influence on the
world.</quote>
   <p>Today the Chancellor will go to Chequers to join a Cabinet
house-party where his new measures to deal with Britain's financial
crisis will be on the agenda.
   <p>Here are other points from his speech yesterday, delivered at a
Conservative fete at Hawarden, Flintshire.
   <p><quote>The trade balance at the present time, in spite of better
figures announced yesterday is unsatisfactory.
   <p><quote>In a tough competitive world, we as a nation are not doing well
enough. That is not a new discovery. I have warned the country again
and again of this since I became Chancellor.
<QUOTE/>
<head>THE TASK</head>
   <p><quote>The time is long past when as individuals, or as a nation we
can expect to live beyond our means. In the long run, as individuals,
we cannot take out in real income more than we contribute in
production or services.
   <p><quote>We cannot achieve stability, let alone speed up our economic
growth, until we have made an improvement in our export performance
far beyond anything we have yet achieved.
   <p><quote>We cannot hope to do this without a tougher and more
competitive spirit in industry, a far more critical attitude towards
costs, whatever their origin, a relentless rooting-out of all
inefficiency, restrictiveness and waste, whether it be of capital
resources or of labour.
   <p><quote>We cannot afford the restrictive practices, whether of
management or labour, that are far too readily accepted now.
   <p><quote>We cannot afford the easy complacency with which increases in
costs derived from these and similar inefficiencies are added to
prices in the confidence that the customer will pay.
   <p><quote>It is not just a matter of working a good deal harder before we
really earn the incomes that are paid.
   <p><quote>Harder work is needed; but above all we need more drive and
better direction, more efficiency and economy in our effort.
<QUOTE/>
<head>OVERDRAWN</head>
   <p><quote>And an inner conviction that these things really matter &mdash; and
indeed are essential if we are not to slip back into becoming a
second-rate economy with declining standards of living.
   <p><quote>We cannot reward ourselves in advance of actual achievement by
increased money incomes, whether in the form of dividends, profits or
wages.

<head>PIC SPONSORS WORLD SPEEDWAY SURPRISE</head>
<head>By Don Clarke</head>
   <p>GOT your ticket for the Sunday Pictorial sponsored World
Championship Speedway British Final (start 7.15 p.m.) at Wembley
Stadium on Saturday?
   <p>Don't waste time. The meeting is not being televised, and
although admission can be obtained on the night, tickets for this
<quote>Night of Nights</quote> are going fast.
   <p>Speedway history should be made at Wembley. Sixteen top British
stars, and possibly two Continental aces, will battle for
Pic-sponsored championships.
   <p>Never before have fans been promised such a feast of speed with
reigning World Champion Ove Fundin sparking the flame that could set
the meeting alight.
   <p>Fundin holds the Pic's British Match Race and <quote>Golden Helmet</quote>
title, and is defending his crown against Southampton's Bjorn
Knutsson.
   <p>At Southampton Fundin was beaten in two straight runs and
suffered the indignity of crashing and wrecking his machine in his
effort to conquer Knutsson. Temper and the needle element flared.
<head>A SCORCHER AT NORWICH</head>
   <p>THE second leg takes place at Norwich next Friday &mdash; and Fundin
should even the score.
   <p>If this happens, the final leg will be decided at Wembley next
Saturday, before the sixteen riders stake claims for the British title
and &pound;720 Pic prize money, which will be presented by stage and screen
comedian Terry-Thomas.
   <p>In the field will be four former World Champions, Ronnie Moore,
Jack Young, Barry Briggs and Peter Craven.
   <p>For Wimbledon's Ronnie Moore, twice Champion, this may be his
last season after ten World Finals. Jack Young is also a doubtful
starter next year.
   <p>Plymouth's Jack Scott, introduced to speedway by Jack Young, is
the only Provincial League rider in a star-studded line-up.
   <p>Last year he won a sizeable sum of money on the football pools
and wisely invested part of his winnings in buying good equipment.
   <p>The fact that he rides in such exalted company will not deter
Scott.
<head>MIKE MEANS BUSINESS</head>
   <p>NINE months ago Mike Broadbanks (Swindon) was advised by his
doctors to quit speedway.
   <p>But the <quote>Red Devil</quote> possesses a stubborn streak, and has
proved them all wrong by battling his way to Wembley.
   <p>That is a pen picture of half a dozen aces. The other ten
competitors can well upset the applecart for the favourites.
   <p>Ron How, Bob Andrews, Cyril Maidment (Wimbledon); Peter Moore,
Ray Cresp (Ipswich); Ken McKinlay (Leicester); Doug. Davies (New
Cross); Neil Street (Swindon); Ronnie Genz (Oxford), and Nigel Boocock
(Coventry) are capable of ignoring reputations.
   <p>Looks like being quite a dust up. I say once again, book your
tickets NOW.
   <p>These can be obtained from your local tracks until Tuesday, or
direct from Speedway Box Office, Wembley Stadium, Wembley, Middlesex.
   <p>Prices are: Covered seats: 21s., 12s. 6d., 10s. 6d.
Uncovered: 8s., 6s. Standing: 3s. 6d.
<head>PLUCKY GELSON</head>
<head>Brentford 1. Reading 2.</head>
   <p>GOAL-HAPPY Reading turned in the kind of powerhouse
performance that has brought them twelve goals in their opening three
games of the season.
   <p>They also handed out a vital Soccer lesson to unfortunate
Brentford &mdash; how to snap up chances!
   <p>Brentford played some promising stuff in midfield, but were
unable to put it to advantage.
   <p>Reading were matched in approach work; never in finishing power.
   <p>Peter Gelson, their burly young centre half, was Brentford's
defensive star in pluckily holding out the determined Reading raids
for long periods.
   <p>Webb scored Reading's second-half winner, a Vallard penalty being
their other. An own goal from Splers was Brentford's only
consolation.
<head>Sillett off</head>
<head>A. Villa 3. Chelsea 1.</head>
   <p>TRAGEDY hit this match in the sixty-fifth minute when Chelsea
skipper and left back Peter Sillett broke a leg, writes ARCHIE
QUICK.
   <p>Chelsea, inspired by the trickery of little David Cliss, played
delightful attacking football till the interval, but, as usual, they
flattered to deceive, and had fallen from their standard before the
Sillett accident.
   <p>Chelsea moved well at the start, despite Villa's seventh-minute
lead. Bobby Thompson headed through following a corner.
   <p>Chelsea, however, equalised after twenty-four minutes. Cliss
cleverly flicked the ball to Ron Tindall, who pushed it through for
Bobby Tambling to score.
   <p>Dougan's persistency enabled young Harry Burrows to put Villa
ahead seconds after the interval, and he bustled to good purpose in
the goalmouth when the other winger, Jimmy MacEwan, got No. 3 from
long distance.
<head>DYSON GRAB</head>
<head>Spurs 4, Arsenal 3: By SAM LEITCH</head>
   <p>CHEEKY, cocky left winger Terry Dyson and his
hell-of-a-hat-trick squeezed both points Spurs' way. But, oh, what
vile luck for the Gunners!
   <p>Eighteen minutes from the end, Spurs were trailing 2-3 after
having led 2-0 inside twenty minutes.
   <p>After an Alan Skirton goal, an Arsenal transformation was worked
by the magic head of Mel Charles. Twice he outjumped the tall,
commanding Tottenham defenders. Twice he scored &mdash; in the 67th and
72nd minutes.
   <p>Two glorious goals &mdash; again Mel looked every inch as good as his
big brother John in getting them &mdash; and they put Arsenal in command.
Then enter whirlwind Dyson. He had already notched one
superbly-headed goal in the first half. But never was his punch and
pace needed so much as now by his gasping, back-pedalling team-mates.
   <p>There were ten minutes left. Arsenal strutted. Arsenal looked
mighty good...
   <p>But tiny Terry wagged his foot at a Cliff Jones corner and the
ball was scrambled home for a dramatic Spurs equaliser.
   <p>Arsenal descended on referee Reg Leafe in an angry swarm. Dyson
had handled, they said. Leafe decisively let the goal stand.
   <p>The Gunners and their fans were still fuming when Dyson lammed in
Spurs' match-winner off the post.
   <p>This is a good Arsenal side. They will not meet Dyson's devilish
opportunism every week. And they won't have so much bad luck.
   <p>Their first-half inferiority was caused by the total inability of
Mel Charles to get by centre half Maurice Norman.
   <p>Mel wandered like a big boy lost. In that time a Les Allen
header put Spurs one up, and Dyson got the second.
   <p>Arsenal keeper McLelland, who had to leave the field three
minutes before the end after colliding with Allen, has slight
concussion.
<head>LESLIE IN SPIN TRAP</head>
<head>Wolves 3, West Ham 2: By STAN HALSEY</head>
   <p>WEST HAM took the lead in eighteen minutes. Musgrove
side-stepped a defender and scored a masterly goal with a twenty-yard
rising drive. And though Murray equalised in thirty-three minutes,
West Ham were still going steadily. Then disaster struck.
   <p>It was in the fifty-fifth minute. Alan Hinton, Wolves' left
winger who was playing his first League game, harassed Kirkup into
conceding a corner.
   <p>Deeley, his opposite number, took a hopeful kind of hook shot.
The ball seemed to be going away and West Ham's goalkeeper, Laurie
Leslie, thought danger had been averted.
   <p>But the ball developed such a crazy spin that Leslie could not
cope with it.
   <p>That goal was just the tonic Wolves needed, and in the
sixty-third minute Murray, capping a slick combined move, made the
score 3-1.
   <p>Three minutes from the end a typical bit of Woosnam Soccer
technique laid on a ball from which Sealey scored West Ham's second
goal.
<head>Grimsby... 3
   <p>Southend... 1</head>
   <p>WITHIN thirty seconds of the start, Grimsby 'keeper Malcolm
White had his hands warmed by shots from Southend leader Norman
Bleanch and right winger Tony Bentley and he got little respite from
the visiting sharpshooters.
   <p>But despite their superiority Southend's ninth minute goal had
more than a rub of good fortune about it.
   <p>A blind drive by Bleanch went off a defender to outside left Bob
Kellard, who easily beat White with a close range shot.
   <p>Ron Rafferty headed Grimsby's sixtieth minute  and Mike
Cullen grabbed the lead by finishing off another Rafferty header.
   <p>And only a minute from the end, left winger Cliff Jones cut in to
net just inside the near post.
<head>Cool Neill is twice given slip</head>
<head>Bolton 2, Arsenal 1: By JIM BEECROFT</head>
   <p>BURLY Billy McAdams, Bolton centre forward, and Terry Neill,
lanky centre half of Arsenal, set a poser for the Northern Ireland
selectors, some of whom watched this game at Burnden.
   <p>For large parts of a moderate match young Neill, regarded as a
fine international prospect, snuffed the experienced McAdams
completely out of the play.
   <p>Often Neill's cool and resourceful covering made Arsenal's
suspect defence seem better than it really was, and left McAdams
looking far from a top-line leader.
<head>BRILLIANT</head>
   <p>But twice, the tough and persistent McAdams evaded the Neill
obstacle with two brilliant pieces of opportunism and chalked up two
goals which deservedly gave Bolton their second victory of the season.
   <p>First of these came in the thirty-sixth minute when McAdams
swiftly snapped up a chance inside the penalty area, swivelled in a
flash and fired smartly past the bewildered McLelland.
   <p>This goal, which wiped out a similar effort by Arsenal centre
forward Mel Charles, was the only thing McAdams had done right until
then. And he did little else until he scored another fine goal in
seventy-five minutes when he beat two men in a yard or so and whizzed
a terrific 20-yard shot into the net.
   <p>Though the Arsenal goal had had several narrow escapes,
especially when shots from Holden and Pilkington hit the bar, it was
not until after the second McAdams goal that Bolton assumed full
command.
   <p>But neither team looked as if they had any chance of becoming
championship contenders.
<head>BRILLIANT BRIGGS IS TOP MAN</head>
   <p>NEW ZEALAND and Southampton Speedway ace Barry Briggs won the
Sunday Pictorial-sponsored British final of the world championship at
Wembley Stadium last night.
   <p>After twenty pulsating heats Briggs, winner of the world title
in 1957 and 1958, showed his world class when he notched fifteen
immaculate points to win the Pic's first prize of &pound;300, presented to
him by comedian Terry-Thomas.
   <p>Pint-sized Peter Craven (Belle Vue and England) took the second
prize of &pound;150, while Wimbledon and New Zealand star Ronnie Moore
gained third place for a prize of &pound;80.
<head>MY HEROES</head>
   <p>Without detracting from the superb performance of Briggs,
Craven and Moore, my heroes of the night were two Englishmen &mdash;
Swindon's Mike Broadbanks and Wimbledon's Cyril Maidment.
   <p>Both these boys set the 50,000 crowd alight in Heat 4 when
Maidment, last out of the starting gate, showed he had no big night
nerves in his first Wembley final.
   <p>For four laps, he and Broadbanks put up a terrific tussle, with
Broadbanks just clinching victory.
   <p>Maidment continued his rip-roaring, full-throttle riding in his
next four rides.
   <p>Although outclassed in his last outing, he notched seven points
on the night to stake a claim for the world final at Malmo on
September 15.
<head>TRAGEDY</head>
   <p>Tragedy struck Broadbanks after his first ride.
   <p>An attack of asthma left him gasping for air and how he managed
to stay on his machine for four more rides, let alone score four more
points and a place at Malmo is beyond me.
   <p>Beside riding for &pound;720 Pic prize money, the sixteen riders were
also battling for nine places in the World Final at Malmo, and results
proved that class tells.
   <p>The other six riders who go forward to the Malmo final are from:
   <p>Ron How, Bob Andrews (Wimbledon), Ken McKinlay (Leicester), 9
pts.; Ray Cresp (Ipswich), 8 pts., Jack Young (Coventry), Ronnie
Genz (Oxford), Cyril Maidment (Wimbledon) and Mike Broadbanks
(Swindon), 7 pts.
   <p>Young, Genz, Maidment and Broadbanks will have to run to decide
who will be odd man out at Malmo on September 15, where they clash
with seven Continentals for the honour of wearing the World crown.
   <p>The seven Continentals are: Reigning World Champion Ove Fundin
(Sweden), Bjorn Knutsson (Sweden), Igor Piechanov (Russia), Rune
Sormander (Sweden), Florian Kapala (Poland), Stanislaw Txocz
(Czechoslovakia) and Gote Nordin (Sweden).

<head>BIG SEARCH IN SCOTLAND</head>
<head>by STAN HALSEY</head>
   <p>Cheque in Scotland! Excuse the play on words, but that's what
it could amount to where Spurs and Chelsea are concerned.
   <p>Bill Nicholson, Spurs boss, has money to spend to maintain
Tottenham's Double Top League and Cup glamour.
   <p>He made another quiet trip across the border the other day and
had a look at Third Lanark outside right, David Hilley, who wouldn't
mind a tilt at Sassenach fame and fortune.

<head>Only Avon's Pride gives full value in Cesarewitch</head>
<head>by TOM FORREST</head>
   <p>HORSE-RACING'S happiest invalid today is jockey Bobby Elliot.
He broke a collarbone only last Thursday, yet his specialist declares
that in three or four days he should be fit for riding gallops... and
then for the plum job of the week &mdash; pushing home Avon's Pride in
the Cesarewitch at Newmarket on Saturday.
   <p>Young bones mend quickly. But the back of a big-race favourite
is no place for a jockey with one wing trailing, so Elliot will have
to pass a pretty stiff midweek try-out &mdash; or trainer Dick Hern must
find a substitute.
   <p>Top-class riders are still available... like Ron Hutchinson or,
at a pound or two overweight, Scobie Breasley or Eph Smith, the most
likely choice as he rode Avon's Pride in his gallop yesterday morning.
   <p>Avon's Pride becomes my final selection, because he alone of the
three Cesarewitch horses recommended a week ago for Autumn Double bets
remains as a first-rate value-for-money proposition.
<head>TUMBLED</head>
   <p>El Surpriso, 33-1 last week-end, has been slashed to 12-1. And
Alcoa's odds have tumbled from 25-1 to 14-1.
   <p>They could still win, but if you have to take these new prices it
looks as if you have already <quote>missed the boat.</quote>
   <p>Avon's Pride has been reduced too, but less spectacularly &mdash; from
14-1 to 12-1. This is a rate that could still be confidently accepted
without the feeling of being short-changed. The four-year-old's
chance is outstanding.
   <p>He has the speed... any horse who can play so powerful a part
in shorter races, as in the 1 1/4-mile Vaux Gold Tankard and Ebor
Handicap, will not be found short of sheer pace with half a mile
further to go.
   <p>He has the stamina... the big win of the season for Avon's
Pride was in Epsom's Roseberry Handicap, of the same 2 1/4-mile length
as the Cesarewitch.
   <p>He has the courage... no horse can do without a stout heart
under the ordeal of that long, lung-bursting Cesarewitch straight.
And in Avon's Pride's whole career he has been often outpointed but
never outbattled.
   <p>The weight. At 7st. 11lb., 3lb. below the middle of
the range, the handicapper has certainly taken an indulgent line.
   <p>Direct form, this season's form, suggests that two of his most
heavily backed rivals &mdash; Angazi (12-1) and Trelawny (14-1) &mdash; must
produce quite unexpected reserves to beat Avon's Pride this week. And
through these horses most of the others can be declared safely held.
   <p>Technique, rather than tactics, will be needed from the jockey.
The Cesarewitch is always a hard-run struggle from the start... that
will suit Avon's Pride, but the rider must use a hustling, strong-arm
style, or the colt might well idle his chance away.
<head>AUTHORITY</head>
   <p>El Surpriso is one they all have to beat. There was no
mistaking the authority of her win at Nottingham last week, and with a
mere 7st. 1lb., and the energetic Ray Reader riding, this filly
could be the weak link to wreck the whole handicap.
   <p>Almost as lightly burdened at 7st. 2lb., is Alcoa.
Though less obviously <quote>thrown in</quote> at the weights, Alcoa is such
a rugged, unrelenting stayer that Mick Greening is sure to be driving
her down the straight with glowing visions of galloping them all into
the ground.
   <p>Among the class horses &mdash; the top half dozen, with weights of
8st. 9lb. or more &mdash; Lester Piggott's mount, Sunny Way (20-1),
is the only one I seriously fear.
   <p>Morecambe is left out because no eight-year-old has ever won
the race; Farrney Fox because his recent form is sadly degenerate;
New Brig because he has not raced since May; Agreement because
he no longer has the force that once won him two Doncaster Cups;
Trelawny because it takes almost 2 1/4 miles before he starts
to warm up.
   <p>Neither 1959 winner Come to Daddy nor his stablemate and
brother Usurper has lived up to high hopes this season. While
Honest Boy Aristarchus, Cold Comfort, Tarquinian and Narratus
are run-of-the-mill stayers who could run well... but hardly well
enough.
<head>SUSPECT</head>
   <p>Persian Lancer's stamina is suspect for a horse at the short
odds of 12-1 &mdash; I believe he will last out only on the best of going.
And Utrillo (25-1) will not race at all on soft ground &mdash; he sulks
unless he can hear his feet rattle.
   <p>Hock-deep mud would be ideal though for Annotation (20-1) and
Python (20-1), both powerful but one-paced plodders. And game
little Angazi is a proven mudlark.
   <p>In Python's stablemate, Night Porter, we have the crankiest
character of them all &mdash; but a real live one at 40-1, if you care to
take a chance on his missing any mud that may be flying from his
rivals' heels. He will refuse to race if any hits his face.
   <p>None of the others seems at all likely to win, and I rate Night
Porter and Sunny Way the best of the long shots. But the final
placings I hope for are AVON'S PRIDE 1, El Surpriso 2, Alcoa 3.
<head>JUST GREAT OUR <squote>ARC</squote> BEST</head>
   <p>A BRAVE turnout of British horses &mdash; Just Great, High Hat and
Tenacity &mdash; take the field at Longchamp this afternoon to challenge the
Swashbuckling European champion, Right Royal 5, in the &pound;50,000 Prix
\de \l'Arc \de Triomphe.
   <p>Ours is a team without a captain. But even with the stay-at-home
ace St. Paddy, waiting for a second-division fade-out at Newmarket
on Friday, Britain's prestige need not suffer in Paris.
   <p>Nobody would call the three raiders a force to flash triumphantly
through the richest race this side of the Atlantic.
   <p>But neither are they, as the French believe, just so many sitting
targets to be blasted aside in the hurricane rush of Right Royal.
   <p>JUST GREAT is no sitter... though he staged something like a
sit-down strike at the starting gate to lose his St. Leger chance.
He lost the Derby too through rough-house treatment by other horses.
   <p>In four remaining races this year, Just Great had a fair chance,
and won them all. I make him best of the British.
   <p>New partner Lester Piggott must get him off with the rest, steer
clear of trouble... and who knows to what heights Just Great may rise?
<head>Formidable</head>
   <p>HIGH HAT is less of a mystery. We know he is no match for
St. Paddy, but he has matched, and mastered, Petite Etoile.
That is a formidable qualification. Duncan Keith rides.
   <p>TENACITY has not yet attacked the top class. But what an
improver this enormous, late-developing filly is.
   <p>Yet to make any of our trio more than an each-way bet would be
more patriotic than prudent. Right Royal is not the only star in
opposition.
   <p>Match 3 will be there... cantering winner of the French St.
Leger. So will stablemate Dicta Drake, on whom Max Garcia has a
chance to make amends for the suicidal tactics which cost them the
Doncaster St. Leger.
   <p>Italian crack Molvedo, with a runaway success at Deauville on his
last French trip, shapes like another Ribot. So he should &mdash; he is a
son of Ribot, and Ribot's jockey, veteran Enrico Camiel rides him too.
   <p>But in that chestnut-strewn Longchamp paddock they will all be
dominated by the magnificence of the loose-limbed giant RIGHT ROYAL.
And all logic points to his being as dictatorial on the track as in
the pre-race parade.

<head>This is Lochroe all over again says DICK FRANCIS</head>
   <p>I TOOK a ride, a few days ago, on an echo from the past &mdash;
on a small-framed, brown four-year-old named Vulgate. The echo? &mdash;
from Lochroe. They are half brothers out of the mare Loch Cash, and
were sired by the top jumping stallions Vulgan and King Hal.
   <p>Vulgate looks as intelligent and handles as easily as Lochroe &mdash;
and jumps in the same style. If he moves less perfectly, it is
because Lochroe was the best-moving 'chaser I have known.
   <p>Trained by Bill Marshall at Cheltenham, the beautifully broken-in
youngster can be seen on Saturday at Fontwell, where he comes out for
the first time this season in the handicap hurdle (4.15).
   <p>At home he does not wear shoes on his hind feet. None of the
Marshall horses do. This ensures that if a hindleg strikes a
foreleg &mdash; a frequent occurrence &mdash; the injury is restricted to
bruising.
   <p>No shoes are needed for road work. The stable yard, on the top
of Cleeve Hill overlooking Cheltenham racecourse leads straight out on
to open commons.
   <p>It is usual for a mare who has produced one winning jumper to
produce others, even if not of the same standard, and generally in
steeplechasers it is the influence of the mare which predominates.
   <p>If one of her progeny jumps well, they all do, (and if one jumps
appallingly they all do!), regardless of the sire.
   <p>Most remarkable examples of half-brothers are Gay Donald and Pas
Seul. Both these Gold Cup winners &mdash; by Gay Light and Erin's Pride
respectively &mdash; had Pas \de Quatre for their dam.
   <p>Both, broken and trained by different trainers, were blundering
jumpers until they were seven, at which age they began to outgrow
their carelessness, and their getaway burst of speed took over.
<head>RELATED</head>
   <p>In Northumberland, the sparkling Kerstin's full brother and
sister &mdash; Vindicated (now with Guy Cunard) and Lady Nenagh &mdash; made their
mark for Verly Bewicke, many of whose horses are related to each
other.
   <p>Another North-country star, Rough Tweed, winner of Manchester's
Champion Novice 'Chase last April, will have a full-brother running
over here this season.
   <p>It is four-year-old Holy Loch, trained by Bobby Norris in
Northamptonshire, who makes his racecourse debut &mdash; over hurdles &mdash;
early in December.
   <p>And I will be most interested in this Irish Youngster's progress.
I gave him his first schooling over jumps in this country last
month &mdash; and he showed he is an apt pupil learning fast.
<head>HONEYMOOR OUT</head>
   <p>Honeymoor, ante-post favourite for the Cambridgeshire
(Newmarket, October 28), has been scratched from the race. He was
cast in his box on Thursday and an X-ray revealed that he had a leg
injury.
   <p>Some bookmakers yesterday made Rachel and Golden Sands joint
favourites at 16-1.
<head>RUGBY UNION SPECIALS</head>
<head>Phil Taylor charge sinks the Scots</head>
<head>London Scottish 6 Northampton 8: by JOHN REED</head>
   <p>ONE must hand it to skipper Phil Taylor and his burly
Northampton men. They shook Richmond rigid three weeks ago at the
Athletic Ground with a grip of iron. Yesterday on the same ground
they retained their unbeaten record (six victories in seven games)
with a superb recovery after the sinewy Scots had led 6-0 for nearly
an hour.
   <p>Five sparkling minutes of fluid, exciting Rugby did the trick.
And the Saints showed what a great side they can be. How rewarding,
then, that the winning try should be scored by beefy Taylor himself.
   <p>After 21 minutes of the second-half England scrum-half Dickie
Jeeps booted the ball high ahead, and Scottish full-back Gordon
Macdonald knocked on.
   <p>It was to prove an expensive error. For the rampaging
Northampton forwards were up in a flash, Clive Daniels whipped the
ball to Taylor and the Northampton captain burst through for the line.
   <p>It would have taken a brick wall to stop him, as he dived over in
the corner for an unconverted try.
   <p>Five minutes earlier the London Scottish defence had been split
asunder. Right wing Frank Sykes, dodging and darting past grasping
hands found himself surrounded.
   <p>He threw out a long, overhead, 20-yard pass to the centre of the
field as if he was a cricketer, fly-half John Shurvington picked it up
neatly on the bounce and shot through to score under the posts.
Full-back Roger Hosen converted.
<head>Great rally</head>
   <p>Northampton had staged a great rally. In the first half they
had looked listless and a little tired in comparison with the
energetic alert Scots. But what a change after the interval.
   <p>Their massive scrum gained firm control in the tight, where Andy
Johnson, who may well win an England trial this season, outhooked
David Hayburn, who was deputising for Scottish international Norman
Bruce (injured) and won the ball frequently against the head.

<head>Ernie wants a showdown on the beer bid</head>
   <p>A PETROL pump attendant who found himself mixed up in a
&pound;21,000,000 takeover bid, said last night he was going to have a

   <p><quote>I want to get this mess sorted out,</quote> said 51-year-old
Ernest Clements. <quote>It's ridiculous.
   <p><quote>I'm mixed up in a deal involving millions &mdash; and I earn only
&pound;12 a week.
   <p><quote>A few hours ago I didn't even know I was a director of this
firm.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Clements, of Ifield Road, Fulham, is registered as a
director of Anglasi Nominees, a &pound;100 company in the City.
   <p>After Anglasi announced a &pound;21,000,000 takeover bid for Bent's
Brewery, Liverpool, the Stock Exchange Council banned dealings in
Bent's shares.
<head>Stepbrothers</head>
   <p>Managing director of Anglasi Nominees is Mr. George Burgess.
<quote>Financial adviser</quote> is Mr. Ron Foster.
   <p><quote>I know them both &mdash; they're my stepbrothers,</quote> said Mr.
Clements, as he downed a double Scotch in a London pub last night.
   <p><quote>But I haven't seen them for years. I've signed no forms, and
I've never bought a share in my life.
   <p><quote>I don't know what's in this. But I'm going to find out. I'm
going to Burgess's office on Monday for a show-down.</quote>
   <p>Then Ernie Clements downed another Scotch. <quote>The very idea &mdash; a

<head>SACK THE MANAGER CRY FANS</head>
   <p>FOUR HUNDRED angry Soccer fans chanted ~<quote>Sack the manager</quote>
outside Newcastle United Football Club's ground yesterday.
   <p>United had just been thrashed 4-0 by Everton, and now look
certain to be relegated to the Football League's Division Two.
Newcastle's manager is ex-winger Charlie Mitten.
   <p>At half-time, with United two goals down, one disgusted fan
climbed the club's flagpole and hauled the Union Jack to half mast.
   <p>It was a riotous day for soccer...
   <p>HORDES of angry supporters besieged referee Mr. B. J.

<head>HUNGER CITY CALLS MAYOR</head>
   <p>MAYOR, stop your roaming. Come home and help your hungry
citizens, instead of trying to kid the world they are NOT hungry.
   <p>That is the call from Labour leaders in the breadline city of
Toronto, to Mayor Nathan Phillips.
   <p>Mayor Phillips, wealthy head of a law firm, is more than 4,000
miles away on a holiday tour of Europe with his wife &mdash; and issuing
denials that there is hunger in his home city.
   <p>As <quote>The People</quote> revealed recently, Britons going to Canada
will find Toronto a city without jobs. A city where hungry men, women
and children line up for food at charity soup kitchens.
   <p>Mayor Phillips was challenged by a Toronto newspaper to tour the
city and see the distress for himself. But the Mayor announced:
~<quote>There is no hunger</quote> &mdash; and left for Europe.
   <p><quote>I'm going to let the people of Europe know that these stories
of starvation in Toronto are all wrong,</quote> he said.
   <p>IN DUBLIN Mayor Phillips said: <quote>There may be some
unemployment in Toronto &mdash; but no widespread hunger or hardship.</quote>
   <p>Earlier, in London, where the Mayor and his wife stayed in the
West End at the expensive Westbury Hotel, he attacked the recent
<quote>People</quote> series on the hardship a Briton met in Canada and
insisted: <quote>There is no starvation in Toronto.</quote>
   <p>And at home in Toronto last Thursday 250 of the Mayor's civic
employees were laid off by the city council.
<head>Ten nurses flop exams &mdash; and a row blows up</head>
   <p>FOR three years, a hospital trained ten student nurses. Then
the girls took their final examinations to become State Registered
Nurses. And then all failed.
   <p>It was not the first time this had happened at the 134-bed
General Hospital at Great Yarmouth.
   <p>Last October, another batch of student nurses trained there
failed the examinations.
   <p>And when the latest batch of results was revealed yesterday, it
started a storm at Great Yarmouth.
   <p>An angry parent of one student nurse who failed said: <quote>This
hundred-per-cent. failure is shocking.
   <p><quote>I don't see how it can be all the fault of the girls.</quote>
   <p>The secretary of Great Yarmouth General Hospital, Mr. John
Egerton, said: <quote>I cannot comment on our results in the State
Registered Nurse examinations.
   <p><quote>A hospital committee meeting is being called to discuss the
matter.</quote>
   <p>The hospital is controlled by the Norwich, Lowestoft and Great
Yarmouth Hospital Management Committee.
   <p>Its matron is named in the Hospital Year Book as Miss G.
Embleton.
   <p>There are two units in the hospital &mdash; the Surgical Unit, in Great
Yarmouth, and the Medical Unit at neighbouring Gorleston-on-Sea.
   <p>The hospital is on the officially approved list of those which
give complete training in nursing.
<head>DON'T SHOW YOUR LEGS: BY ORDER</head>
   <p>FASHION-CONSCIOUS policewomen in Nottingham have been told
by their spinster boss to stop shortening their skirts.
   <p>The girls thought their skirts were too old fashioned so they
shortened them by tucking them over at the waist. Then Chief
Inspector Jessie Alexander found out.
   <p>Miss Alexander, who wears a long skirt, is also angry with the
tailors who supply uniforms.
   <p>She claims that one of her policewomen, newly-wed Mrs. Sheila
Williams, has been issued with a skirt that is far shorter than
regulation length.
   <p><quote>There has been a slip-up,</quote> she said. <quote>In fact my own new
uniform was out of shape and I have sent it back.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Williams said yesterday: <quote>I do not think my skirt is too
short. It is just below my knees.
   <p><quote>I do not see why I should lengthen the skirt &mdash; long skirts look
old fashioned &mdash; but if Miss Alexander insists, I suppose it will have
to be done.</quote>
   <p>MALE COMMENT: Nottingham's Chief Constable &mdash; Mr. Thomas
Moore &mdash; said: <quote>There is a standard pattern for the length of
policewomen's skirts, so we must follow it.</quote>
<head>All worked up about statue of a worker</head>
   <p>A UNION ordered a &pound;100 statue to represent the British
engineer at work. But when the union members saw how the statue was
shaping they were FURIOUS...
   <p>For the statue &mdash; designed by 31-year-old sculptor John Paddison
for the Amalgamated Engineering Union's Wolverhampton district
committee &mdash; shows an engineer with his coat half on and half off.
   <p>Sculptor Paddison says the engineer is taking his coat OFF &mdash;
eager to get to work.
   <p>But the Wolverhampton engineers say the man is putting his coat
ON &mdash; eager to get AWAY from work.
<head>Coat on &mdash; or off?</head>
   <p>And that, they complain, creates a false impression that the
British workman is interested only in dashing off as soon as the
whistle blows.
   <p>Said factory engineer John Williams: <quote>It's quite obvious from
the man's posture he is putting his coat on in a hurry.
   <p><quote>Outsiders will get the impression engineers are only interested
in getting out of the factory as soon as possible.</quote>
   <p>Said Mr. Paddison, of Riches Street, Wolverhampton: <quote>As far
as I'm concerned, the man is taking his coat off &mdash; and that's the way
it's staying.</quote>
   <p>The 4 ft. high statue will be finished in six weeks and shown
at the local art gallery.
<head>THE B-AND-B RAIDER</head>
   <p>POLICE were yesterday searching for the bed-and-breakfast
raider. After breaking into a factory at Soho Hill, Handsworth,
Birmingham, he set an alarm clock belonging to one of the staff and
went to sleep in the managing director's chair.
   <p>He stole about &pound;3 from the canteen, which he entered with the
help of factory tools, and also helped himself to eggs and milk.
<head>Gaoled woman let out &mdash; to steal</head>
   <p>A WOMAN serving a two-year sentence at Holloway was taken
from the prison to a mental hospital at Friern Barnet. On Friday she
was allowed out for four hours.
   <p>She went to the West End and committed her 14th crime; she stole
two blouses from a store, it was said at Marlborough Street yesterday.
   <p>The magistrate, Mr. Paul Bennett, V.C., discharged Mrs.
Kathleen Clark, of Grenville Street, King's Cross, absolutely and
ordered her return to hospital.
<head>Bow-WOW of a party</head>

<head>MOTHER SOLD CHILD &mdash; FOR 28s.</head>
   <p>A MOTHER was arrested yesterday and charged with selling her
five-year-old daughter for &pound;1 8s.
   <p>She is 33-year-old Mrs. Elsie Joseph, of Seattle, Washington
State, whose husband, August, is wanted by the police on a similar
charge.
   <p>They have seven children.
   <p>Seattle police say that a Mr. Wilbert Bippus, 35, told them he
and his wife had wanted to adopt a child and he offered to buy the
Josephs' daughter.
   <p>He paid &pound;1 8s. and took the girl home, but his wife made him
return the child.
<head>Banker's son Jeremy sued for debt</head>
   <p>THE banking family of Lubbock has had its biggest shock since
son Jeremy, fresh down from university, flouted mother when she
pleaded, <quote>Darling, DON'T become a musician.</quote>
   <p>Jeremy Lubbock, now 30 and a piano player in a West End night
club, has not paid up a debt, it was said in the High Court.
   <p>So a Receiving Order in Bankruptcy has been served on him &mdash; and
some of Jeremy's friends are wondering: What would grandfather have
said about that?
   <p>For GRANDFATHER Cecil Lubbock, 83 when he died in 1956, was a
boss of the Bank of England, 32 years a director and for two years
deputy governor.
<head>Spurned</head>
   <p>And what is FATHER saying? For father Michael Lubbock, a
cousin of Lord Avebury, followed the tradition that Jeremy spurned and
is a director of the Bank of London and South America, and the banking
firm of S. G. Warburg and Co.
   <p>Pianist Jeremy himself took time off from the keys to tell what
HE thinks about it. <quote>It's most unfortunate,</quote> he said.
   <p>But is the banker's son (family motto ~<quote>The Author Makes the
Value</quote>) likely to be made a bankrupt? <quote>No, I can promise you there
is no prospect of that,</quote> said Jeremy.
   <p><quote>My assets exceed my liabilities. Everything is being ironed
out. I have the money although I am disputing the debt.</quote>
   <p><quote>You know,</quote> he said, <quote>I'm no dabbler at music. It is my
career.</quote>
<head>BISHOP ASKS COUPLE TO FORGIVE PARSON</head>
   <p>THE Bishop of Coventry is to ask a vicar why he did not marry
two teenage parishioners.
   <p><quote>I shall go into this matter very fully,</quote> said the Bishop,
Dr. Cuthbert Bardesley.
   <p>The vicar is the Rev. Eric Jarvis, of the Warwickshire village
of Ansley, who was to have married 19-year-old Barry Wright and
Margaret Wilson, 18, at St. Thomas's Church, Coventry.
   <p>But five days before Mr. Jarvis told the couple he would not
marry them unless he was ordered to by his Bishop.
   <p>As a result, Barry and Margaret got married at another church,
after a delay of eight days.
   <p>Barry's mother protested to the Bishop. He has written back
saying he is glad the marriage did take place, and adding: &mdash;

   <p><quote>I hope that now you and your son and daughter-in-law will
forgive and forget, and that you will urge the young couple to receive
all the help they can through prayer and worship.</quote>

   <p>Last night Barry, of Birmingham Road, Ansley, said: <quote>From the
first time we met the vicar he seemed to have something against us.
   <p><quote>He was particularly interested in finding out why we weren't
having a white wedding. At the wedding rehearsal the vicar told us he
would write to the Bishop and tell him that he had two non-active
Christians in the parish.
   <p><quote>He said that if he were told to marry us he would resign.
   <p><quote>Margaret was terribly upset,</quote> added Barry.
   <p><quote>I went back and told the vicar that we would be married in
another church. There was nothing else I could do &mdash; it might have
meant his resignation otherwise.</quote>
   <p>At Ansley vicarage, Mr. Jarvis said: <quote>The decision to go
elsewhere was theirs.
   <p><quote>But I did tell them that in a certain set of circumstances I
would write to the Bishop and if he told me to marry them I would have
to consider resigning.</quote>

<text id=LOBA25>
<head>Mr. Forte To The Rescue?</head>
   <p>A SCHEME to unscramble the so-called Jasper group of
companies may be announced before the end of this month. For some
time now negotiations have been going on between the State Building
Society and a group believed to be headed by Mr. Charles Forte, the
caterer.
   <p>The basis of the talks have been, firstly, that the depositors of
the State should at least be repaid 20s. in the pound, even if they
may suffer some loss of interest, and secondly, that there should be
an offer &mdash; on the basis of independent accountants' valuations &mdash; for
all the shares in all the group companies, whose stock exchange
quotations have been suspended.
   <p>Altogether, the State has lent about &pound;7 million to various
companies in the group, but the chief problem is the &pound;3 1/4 million
borrowed by Friedrich Grunwald, its driving force, at present serving
a five-year prison sentence.
   <p>Grunwald also borrowed &pound;1 1/2 million from Mr. Maxwell Joseph,
the hotelier, and it seems certain that a solution will depend on
Mr. Joseph foregoing a considerable part of this, as well as on
Mr. Grunwald and Herbert Murray (formerly of the State Building
Society, now also in prison) surrendering the greater part of their
own personal holdings in group companies.
   <p>Mr. Forte's interest in taking over the group plainly lies in
the catering opportunities offered. Among the group's assets are the
Piccadilly, Rubens and Rembrandt hotels in London, as well as a number
of provincial hotels.
   <p>It also owns a number of news theatres and, among others, the
<quote>Classic</quote> chain of repertory cinemas. Finally, there are 43
billiard halls for which Mr. Forte may well have other plans.
   <p>But there is also a substantial property interest, above all the
&pound;4 million Dolphin Square block of flats. The scheme therefore
hinges on finding a property group to take over this aspect of the
Grunwald <quote>empire.</quote>
   <p>More than one property company has already shown an interest in
this, but a well-known &pound;15 million London group specialising in
residential property seems at present the most likely bet.
   <p>Things at last seem to be looking up for the thousands of
long-suffering State Building Society depositors. Even if the present
scheme falls through &mdash; which now seems unlikely &mdash; there is a City
merchant bank now waiting quietly on the sidelines with an alternative
scheme in its pocket.
<head>New Recruit</head>
   <p>MR. GERALD GLOVER'S election last week to the board of City
of London Real Property provides an interesting link between one of
the most active property development groups and a company whose
immense possibilities has  made eyes other than those of
Mr. Cotton and Mr. Clore take a long, lingering, glance in its
direction.
   <p>Among other things, Mr. Glover is chairman of Edger
Investments, the development company whose latest achievement has been
the Carlton Tower Hotel in Sloane Street, London. Like many another
property company it has attracted the backing of a leading insurance
company &mdash; none other than the Prudential.
   <p>Perhaps even more important, however, for Edger is the backing it
enjoys from Development Securities, which owns one-third of the
equity. This company, whose principal asset is the Dorchester Hotel
and whose shares have so far this year risen from 81s. to a new high
of 110s, is in turn controlled by the wealthy McAlpine family.
   <p>Until now the only connection between CLRP and the
McAlpine-Glover interests lay in the vast Stag Brewery site at
Victoria, which is 51 p.c. owned by CLRP, 25 p.c.
by Development Securities and 24 p.c. by Edger.
   <p>The new move should at least serve to boost the pace of
developing this site, from which the &pound;4 million Edger should &mdash;
proportionately &mdash; benefit most. With a yield of little more than 1
p.c. at the current price of 28s. 3d. the shares are
essentially a long-term investment. But one which should prove
rewarding.
<head>ICI's Bad Example</head>
   <p>IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES should certainly have no
difficulty in finding underwriters for its next <quote>rights</quote> issue. As
a result of its decision to revert to the bad old practice, gradually
being rejected by the more progressive companies, of letting the
underwriters get the benefit of the rights inadvertently not taken
up &mdash; in this case nearly 3 per cent. of the &pound;34 million issue &mdash;
there has been an underwriting <quote>bonus</quote> of no less than &pound;280,000.
   <p>It is of course true, as Mr. Paul Chambers, the ICI
chairman, has pointed out, that at the time of the issue the rights
were worth only 9d. a share, and that if the shares not taken up
were to be sold for the benefit of the shareholders whose rights they
were &mdash; the normal modern practice &mdash; this would involve considerable
administrative work.
   <p>But this is a matter of principle. Underwriters are adequately
recompensed for the services they perform without the necessity of a
pourboire at the expense of innocently negligent &mdash; or merely absent &mdash;
shareholders. ICI should be setting a better example than
this.
<head>Forward Strip</head>
   <p>WHAT tax changes are likely in this month's Budget? One
innovation the Government has been seriously considering &mdash; and which
may yet come about &mdash; is the introduction of a flat rate Corporation
Tax to replace the present combination of income tax and profits tax
on company profits.
   <p>This would have the obvious merit of recognising the important
difference between company and personal taxation. It would also, I
believe, be welcomed by the inland Revenue (normally averse to any
major change) as a means of helping them in their endless battle
against the dividend strippers.
   <p>For those few readers unacquainted with this sport I should
perhaps explain that dividend stripping is essentially a device for
extracting accumulated reserves from a private trading company without
paying tax. In its simplest form it used to work in the following
way.
   <p>The trading company with, say, &pound;100,000 of reserves and &pound;50,000
of other assets is sold to a finance company for &pound;150,000. The
finance company then pays itself a dividend of &pound;100,000 and sells the
trading company back to its original owners for &pound;50,000. The latter
are then left with the company plus &pound;100,000 in cash &mdash; the object of
the exercise.
   <p>The finance company, however, whose business is dealing in shares
and other property and is thus taxed on capital gains, can offset the
&pound;100,000 loss in buying and reselling the business against the
dividend received. Hence it, too, has no tax liability.
<head>Revenue's Chagrin</head>
   <p>Last year's Finance Act &mdash; in particular the <quote>blanket</quote>
Section 28 &mdash; was meant to have put a stop to all this. But although
the crude method just outlined is no longer possible, a roaring trade
is still being done &mdash; much to the Revenue's chagrin &mdash; in some of the
more esoteric refinements of dividend stripping. Among them are the
methods known among the professionals as the <quote>Scissors,</quote> Stock
Shunting and the Forward Strip.
   <p>The first two are highly complex operations, usually used in
property deals. The forward strip, however, was specially designed
for those people who have not yet made their profits &mdash; actors, for
example. Here, a company is formed to exploit the actor's services
over the next five years.
   <p>In essence what happens is that the drop in value of the shares
in this company (at the end of the five years they are worthless) is
offset against the actor's earnings over the period. How many of our
leading actors are anxiously waiting for April 17 to find out whether
they will be able to continue their forward strip?
<head>THIS WEEK'S DIVIDENDS</head>
<head>Reyrolle: Phoenix</head>
   <p>HIGHLIGHT of this week's dividend news will come from A.
Reyrolle, the big North-country electrical engineers who report on
Friday. The difficulties through which the heavy electrical industry
has passed in recent years are well enough known and they haven't left
Reyrolle scatheless.
   <p>These went further than a mere check to growth, and at one time
brought trading profits down from the peak of &pound;3,909,000 in 1955 by
nearly &pound;1 million.
   <p>Last year trading profits had climbed back to &pound;3,134,000, but
the market is not particularly sanguine that 1960 will have seen much
further recovery &mdash; profit margins were probably too slim for that.
Last year's agreement with Associated Electrical Industries for joint
research has probably not been in force long enough to bring big
savings yet, but it should do so in time.
   <p>Meanwhile Reyrolle has never cut its dividend which has been held
at the equivalent of 8 1/4 per cent on present capital for the past
four years. Earnings a year ago were 25 per cent. The interim has
been maintained this year at 3 1/4 per cent and expectation is that
the final will again be 5 1/2 per cent &mdash; anything more would please
the market. The shares have risen in the past two months by about
7s. in line with other heavy electricals, on hopes that the industry
has now passed its worst.
<head>Chemicals Prosperity</head>
   <p>Better profits are expected from Associated Chemical
Companies when the figures for 1960 are announced next Thursday.
A.C.C., formerly British Chrome &amp; Chemicals, has expanded
rapidly in recent years and is now a sizeable group controlling assets
worth more than &pound;11 million. Trading profits have risen from about
&pound;250,000 to &pound;1,345,000 in the past 10 years.
   <p>Last year's total distribution of 15 p.c. came from earnings
of 38 p.c. so an increase is well within the company's powers
especially as the cash position is good. On the other hand the
directors may be conservative again because of expansion plans.
   <p>A free scrip issue cannot be ruled out. It must surely come some
day with reserves and undistributed profits now totalling nearly &pound;4
million by comparison with an issued equity capital of &pound;2,154,000.
The last scrip issue was seven years ago.
   <p>Profits of Mitchells, Ashworth &amp; Stansfield, the Lancashire
manufacturers, dyers and printers of felts who now have considerable
interests in the carpet trades, are expected to be lower. This will
have been caused by running-in troubles with their new plant.
   <p>There can hardly be much fear, however, of a reduced
distribution, so strong is the company's financial position. For
several years past the company has added a 6 1/2 p.c. tax free
distribution from capital profits to its dividend.
<head>Cash Resources</head>
   <p>A year ago the balance sheet disclosed cash and investments
totalling nearly &pound;800,000 by comparison with an issued capital which
is still only &pound;417,000 after the one-for-four scrip issue.
Two-thirds of the investments are in quoted stocks and some
shareholders have been pressing for a return of capital.
   <p>Steps are in hand to repay the &pound;119,000 of Preference capital
and interest in the company's report centres chiefly on what further
moves will be made to distribute some of the surplus cash resources.
   <p>The 5s. shares of Phoenix Assurance have risen about 30s.
this year and 50s. from the low point last year. This reflects
market hopes that there will at last be an increase on the 100
p.c. dividend maintained for the past six years, albeit with one
tiny scrip issue of one-for-20.
   <p>Nevertheless Phoenix shares at around 160s. still yield just
over 3 p.c. This is high by comparison with the 1 1/4 to 1 3/4
p.c. returns shown by such companies as Equity Law, General
Accident, Legal &amp; General and Eagle Star. But after the <squote>no
change</squote> shock from Legal and General it would be as well not to
expect much.

<head>Italy Seeks Firms From Britain</head>
   <p>ITALY is actively looking for British firms wishing to
start manufacturing within the Common Market. Already Inbucon, a
British firm of business consultants has been engaged by Finmeccanica,
the large holding company, to look for suitable candidates.
   <p>Finmeccanica has substantial interests in Alfa-Romeo and Ansaldo,
the important Genoa shipyard. It is offering to finance wholly or in
part new British manufacturing ventures in Italy.
   <p>Finmeccanica is itself owned by the vast semi-autonomous

<head>No Future For Small Atomic Reactors?</head>

<head>THE BIGGEST CONTEST IN THE WORLD</head>
<head>After four months' travel in Russia and the United States MERVYN
JONES compares life in the two competing super-Powers and the
attitudes of their people</head>
   <p>TO say that it is nice to be home, after four months and
seven thousand miles of travel in America and Russia, is true in more
than one way. Appreciation of living in England, now amply
reinforced, is the least of it. The greatest relief is not to be at
either pulling end in the global tug-of-war.
   <p>Whether we call it cold war or peaceful competition, the contest
between the two super-Powers is a burden of which they will never be
free in what we can discern of the future. The material weight of
this burden, considerable in America, is enormous in Russia. Its
psychological weight is incalculable for two peoples whose
inclination, from reasons of geography and tradition, is to want the
rest of the world to stop bothering them.
   <p>This is evident, notably, with regard to the race to the moon.
For us in England, according to individual outlook, the exploration
of space is either a silly game or a glorious endeavour of the human
spirit. For the contestants, it is no joke and no fun either. It is
something that has to be done because the other side is doing it.
<head>Teacher's view of space flights</head>
   <p>For Americans, Russia's lead in the race is as grim a matter as
Japan's initiative after Pearl Harbour. Of the possible reactions,
sheer denial was commoner than I could have expected. A famous
columnist explained in detail how the Gagarin and Titov flights had
been (not <quote>might have been</quote>) fabricated. A mother, sensible enough
to believe in them, asked me what she should say to her child after
the teacher had told the class they were a fake. <quote>Tell her what you
think,</quote> I said; but in a conformist small town this was evidently as
hard as for an atheist parent to challenge religious instruction.
   <p>Belief in the flights necessarily implied gloom. As I bought my
paper at the candy store on the day of the Titov flight, the headlines
were big and black. The shopkeeper's wife glanced at them and said:
<quote>Isn't it just too awful?</quote>
   <p>The third reaction was to take comfort in America's way of doing
things. <quote>Ours,</quote> said a young teacher, <quote>is a democratic space
programme.</quote> By this he meant that it was attended by publicity and
by care for human life. I had been assured several times that
half-a-dozen Russians are whirling dead through space. <quote>We could
have a man on the moon in six months if we just shot them off
regardless,</quote> said the teacher.
   <p>None of these people was excited by the thought of an American in
space. <quote>The whole thing's crazy when you think of half the world
starving,</quote> said an economics student at Cleveland. But he added:
<quote>I guess we've got to do it.</quote>
<head>Getting ready for massacre</head>
   <p>For the Russians, who enjoy the lead, one might expect it to be
an inspiration. For some of them, it is. A woman pulling potatoes on
an especially primitive collective farm, and lunching as I spoke to
her on dry bread and gherkins, said: <quote>Don't judge our country by
what you see &mdash; we've got the first man in space.</quote> The surprise was
to meet Russians (not intellectuals, but common folk) who took a
contrary view.
   <p>An engineer: <quote>It's not the right way to use millions of
roubles, with conditions as they are.</quote> A miner's wife: <quote>It won't
do any harm, if we can believe it's for peaceful purposes, but it
would have been better to build more hospitals.</quote> A tractor driver:
<quote>We don't say this publicly, you understand, but most of us think
it's a waste of money.</quote>
   <p>At this, the tractor driver's mate grinned and said: <quote>People
say Titov was really sent up to photograph America.</quote> I asked if he
thought the space flights justified. He shrugged: <quote>Might do one
good thing &mdash; prove once and for all there's no God up there.</quote>
   <p>What is taken for granted, both in America and in Russia, is that
there would be no sputniks if there were no military rockets. Which
brings me to the gloomiest aspect of my journey: the spectacle of two
great peoples getting ready to massacre each other.
   <p>It is a clich&eacute; to say that neither the American nor the
Russian people want war, but it is true. With the Russians, it is a
simple matter of scars yet unhealed. Time and again, people gripped
me by the arm, told ghastly stories of the Nazi invasion, and asked:
<quote>Can you imagine that we would start a war?</quote> It is impossible to
doubt their sincerity.
   <p>With the Americans, there are several strands. They have a great
deal to lose. They have, even now, a deep suspicion of militarism, of
<quote>the brass,</quote> of the gearing of the nation to war. A young
ornithologist, asked how he came to choose his profession, explained:
<quote>After I graduated I was in chemistry, but I found they were using
it for war. I switched to electronics, and it was the same. I sat
down to figure out what they couldn't use for war, and what I came up
with was birds.</quote>
<head>No real awareness of nuclear threat</head>
   <p>Add to this a still potent distrust of foreign entanglements.
The evening after the President's July 25 speech, announcing a
readiness to fight for Berlin and an increase in the call-up &mdash; a
speech which caused more alarm over interrupted careers than
satisfaction &mdash; I chatted over a coffee with a factory worker. He was
all enthusiasm: it was a wonderful speech, he was behind Kennedy all
the way. Then he said abruptly: <quote>A good thing we haven't got Truman
in the White House now. Never was any need to fight in Korea, and if
he was around we'd be fighting in Germany now.</quote>
   <p>But, sad to relate, <quote>they want peace</quote> is not the whole story.
One has to add that both Americans and Russians are ready to
contemplate war. The reason is that neither people has any real
awareness of what nuclear war would mean.
   <p>Union Square in New York is a public forum, comparable to
Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. As a listening-post, it is more
instructive than Hyde Park because nobody gets on a platform. A man
with something on his mind starts to talk, and those around him join
in.
   <p><quote>You gotta admit,</quote> a young man was saying as I neared a
sizeable group, <quote>that things advance when there's a war. We got
penicillin because of the last war, and we'll get something else next
time.</quote>
   <p>A religious pacifist intervened: <quote>Did you ever see a picture of
Hiroshima?</quote> The first speaker countered: <quote>Aw, Hiroshima &mdash; did you
ever see a man mangled by a bus?</quote>
   <p>Another man observed with an air of sagacity: <quote>Wars are fought
for real estate. They kick it around for a bit, then they divide it
up. Look at Korea, look at Vietnam.</quote> Another summed up: <quote>There
always will be wars, it don't matter how much you talk.</quote> I broke in
to ask if anyone disagreed with this proposition. Among about fifty
people, nobody did.
<head>Lecture on need for disarmament</head>
   <p>Nobody in Russia would talk about the benefits of war. But
when a Russian talks of the horrors of war, he is talking a different
language from a nuclear disarmer. The very intensity of past
experience inhibits thought of a worse future.
   <p>Once, a man who had experienced Nazi occupation told me how the
Germans knocked people about and turned them out of their homes to
freeze. He wound up, inevitably: <quote>We don't want to see that
again.</quote> I said: <quote>One thing that's certain is that you won't.
You'll see either peace or death in a split second.</quote> He stared at
me, wondering what I was talking about.
   <p>At a restaurant in Kursk, three Russians lectured me on the need
for disarmament and cited the speech Khrushchev had made the previous
day at Stalingrad (sorry, Volgograd). Nettled by some remarks by \de
Gaulle, the Soviet Premier had declared that France would be
obliterated in another war and added: <quote>However, it is impossible to
destroy the Soviet Union.</quote>
<head>Americans' inborn optimism</head>
   <p>I said that Khrushchev was quite right about France, and
Britain, too, but unduly sanguine about his own country. Nuclear
weapons, I went on, could destroy the human race. Signalling to the
waitress for another round of Cuban rum, one of the Russians said
positively: <quote>Not the Soviet Union.</quote>
   <p>It is equally inconceivable for Americans that their country
could cease to function as an organised society. Paradoxically, the
civil defence drive strengthens this feeling. Estimates of how many
people would be killed, however horrific, merely suggest how many
would be saved. With their inborn optimism, many Americans envisage
the aftermath of nuclear attack as a period of getting back on their
feet, like the day after a hurricane.
   <p>The point is often made that Americans have never known modern
war on their soil. It is sometimes forgotten that Russians have never
known long-range bombing. The blitz on London was a frustrated
substitute for invasion. Leningrad was shelled and many Russian towns
were devastated by street-fighting, but Moscow &mdash; with the Germans
almost in the suburbs &mdash; never had an air raid on the London scale, and
behind the lines was behind the lines. It is natural to think with
some confidence of keeping the enemy out next time.
   <p>Russians do, of course, know about nuclear bombs and missiles.
But everyone hopes that his home town will not be a target, and they
have been told very little about fallout. Defence, therefore, means
defence for them.
<head>Views that go unchallenged</head>
   <p>To this, one has to add the general conviction that <quote>our
side</quote> is in the right, and acting defensively, over what Russians
call the German question and Americans the Berlin crisis. The view
that Khrushchev is simply trying to settle the German problem on a
sensible basis is, of course, never publicly challenged in Russia.
The view that Kennedy is simply trying to maintain a position
unreasonably attacked by the Soviet Union is seldom publicly
challenged in America. For people who do not rule out <quote>war if
necessary,</quote> the mood is not far on either side from: <quote>We don't
want to fight, but by jingo if we do...</quote>
   <p>Any glossary of the Russo-American political vocabulary (and I am
thinking of everyday speech as well as official statements) must
include these entries: <quote>Threat: a bellicose move made by our
opponents. Warning: a bellicose move made by us.</quote> I have met both
Americans and Russians who were genuinely saddened by the resumption
of nuclear tests, which was in the offing while I was in America and
happened while I was in Russia. It meant that hopes had been dashed,
and it showed how bad things were getting. But I met nobody who
thought it actually wrong if their leaders found it necessary.
   <p>One might sum up by recording two posters in the same street in
Kiev. The first showed a mother clutching a child and read: <quote>For
their sake, we must have peace.</quote> The other showed a steel-helmeted
soldier with levelled bayonet and read: <quote>Ready for the defence of
the Motherland.</quote> I feel sure that both meet with general approval.
   <p>Cold war, nevertheless, is less intense than hot war in more than
one respect. The antagonism is less total, and among both peoples
there is a refreshing absence of the undiscriminating hatred known in
the last war as Vansittartism.
   <p>This is easy for the Americans. They reason that, since one can
be loyal to America and oppose Kennedy, one can be fond of Russia
while loathing Khrushchev. There is in fact a certain vogue for
Russia in the United States. Far more young people are learning the
Russian language than in Britain, and they are not all hoping for jobs
with the Voice of America.

<head>A.E.U. National Committee's Demand May Cost &pound;30 Million</head>
<head>ENGINEERS' THREE-WEEK HOLIDAY CALL</head>
<head>Revised Pay Basis Claim</head>
   <p>THE resumed conference of the A.E.U. National Committee
at Eastbourne today passed a resolution reaffirming the demand for a
third week's holiday, and eight statutory holidays with pay for three
million workers.
   <p>It also asked for a revision of holiday pay to be based on
average earnings for all and a minimum of &pound;2 13s. 6d. a day for
time workers.
   <p>It is estimated that this claim, if conceded, would cost the
employers between &pound;25 to &pound;30 million a year.
   <p>Mr. L. Smith (Sidcup), the mover, said that many employed in
public service already had three weeks holiday and also many white
collar workers, including draughtsmen, who were winning the day in
negotiations with individual firms.
   <p>He thought Britain was lagging behind many on the Continent who
had longer holidays.
<head>WORK STRAIN</head>
   <p>Mr. W. J. Daniel (Worcester) urged that it was vitally
necessary to have longer breaks from work because of the stress and
strain of working 50 weeks in the year.
   <p><quote>Mental hospitals and homes are being filled because of the
strain of modern industry,</quote> he declared.
   <p></quote>I think we can get the British Medical Association and
hospital authorities on our side on this,</quote> he said.
   <p>Mrs. M. E. Sparks (Birmingham) said that employers were
beginning to recognise that tea breaks were necessary because they
revitalised the workers' energy. Under automation work was getting
more monotonous and that was bringing mental and bodily illness.
<head>NEW GRADE</head>
   <p>Mr. W. J. Carron (President) pointed out that in some
sections of industry, under the pressure of the rank and file,
increased holidays had been agreed based on length of service and
other qualifications.
   <p>There had also been an extension of a new grade known as manual
staff where attractions, including longer holidays, were being offered
to the rank and file and were being accepted.
<head>Short-time Figures Slashed in Car Factories</head>
   <p>IMPROVEMENT in the motor industry situation was reflected in
figures issued after today's monthly meeting of the Midland Regional
Board for Industry.
   <p>The number of people estimated to be on short time has dropped
from a total of 29,400 including 21,500 car workers a month ago, to a
total of 12,000 including just under 8,000 car workers.
   <p>The total number unemployed in the last month has fallen by 2,800
to just over 29,000.
   <p>Major C. R. Dibben, chairman of the board, told a Press
conference, that most workers in the industry were now back to a full
working week. <quote>Although the revival in car sales appears to be
largely in the home market and difficulties in the exports' markets
have continued, there is hope in the industry that the success of
British cars at recent motor shows abroad foreshadows further
increases in activity in the industry during the next four or five
months,</quote> he said.
<head>EXPORT CAMPAIGN</head>
   <p>In Coventry, on April 10, there were 3,440 unemployed including
700 on short time.
   <p>A greater awareness of the need for exports by Midland
manufacturers was reported by Mr. C. J. Holman, regional
director of the Board of Trade. As a result of the Government's
export campaign, inquiries to the Board's Birmingham offices from
firms had increased by 55 per cent. They came from about 600 firms
all over the Midlands.
   <p>A change to a decimal coinage system: <quote>as quickly as possible</quote>
was recommended by the regional board after hearing views of members.
<head>Motor Exports Down in First Quarter</head>
   <p>CAR exports for the first quarter of this year at 85,219,
represented the lowest quarterly figure since 1956, the Board of Trade
said today.
   <p>It was 5,000 below the figure for the final quarter of 1960 and
nearly 100,000 below that for the first quarter of 1960.
   <p>Car output for the quarter, at 218,003, was well below any
quarterly figure for 1959 and 1960.
   <p>But the Board's monthly statistics showed a brighter picture for
commercial vehicles. The totals for exports in the quarter, at 48,358
and production, at 119,745, were both well above corresponding figures
for any quarter in 1959-60. (<quote>Motor Industry Expansion Hopes
Questioned</quote> &mdash; Page 6.)
<head>ALGERIAN PARATROOP ATTACK BEATEN OFF</head>
<head>First Shots in Revolt</head>
   <p>FIRST fighting in the Algeria revolt broke out today when
loyal forces repulsed an attempt by paratroops to storm the naval base
of Mers \el Kebir, near Oran, western Algeria.
   <p>According to official sources quoted by the French agency a
French light cruiser fired warning shots as paratroops approached the
base.
   <p>Unconfirmed reports said troops and Marines resisted the attack
and the paratroops withdrew soon afterwards.
   <p>Two battalions of French motorised infantry were reported to have
crossed the Rhine into France today, as the Armed Forces Ministry
announced the recall of troops and armour from the 60,000 strong force
in Germany to strengthen the Paris area.
   <p>The capital had passed a second night of vigil against a possible
airborne invasion from Algeria.
<head>Food Rush</head>
   <p>It was also announced that 10,000 reservists had been recalled
and the 16th Infantry Division put on a war footing.
   <p>A message from President De Gaulle will be read to the French
National Assembly and Senate this afternoon.
   <p>The French Grocers' Federation appealed to people today not to
create a rush on foodstuffs. They said there was no reason to fear a
food shortage.
   <p>The appeal follows a rush by Parisian housewives yesterday to
stock up with food.
<head>LAOS CEASE-FIRE NEAR?</head>
   <p>THE Royal Laotian Government has accepted the appeal made
yesterday by the co-chairmen of the Geneva agreement (the British and
Soviet Foreign Ministers), for a cease-fire in Laos.
   <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said in London today: <quote>We very much
welcome the Royal Laotian Government's acceptance of the cease-fire
appeal.</quote>
   <p>The Soviet Government is taking steps to bring the cease-fire
appeal to the notice of the Left-wing Pathet Lao forces.
<head>Move for Coach Drinks Fails</head>
   <p>A MOVE to enable alcoholic drinks to be sold to passengers in
public vehicles on specified services was defeated today.
   <p>Mr. William Clark, Conservative M.P. for Nottingham
South, proposed a new clause to the Government's Licensing Bill so
that such drinks could be permitted.
   <p>He told the Standing Committee on the Bill: <quote>You can eat in a
long-distance coach in this country, you can softly drink, but you
cannot have alcoholic drink.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Marcus Lipton (Lab., Brixton) said he supported the new
clause but he would not like to see <quote>24 hours drinking going on &mdash;
combined cruising and boozing while enjoying the beauties of the
countryside.</quote>
<head>Public Concern</head>
   <p>Mr. Dennis Vosper, Minister of State, Home Office, said there
ought not to be a close association of alcohol and road transport when
there was so much public concern about road accidents.
   <p>Mr. Harold Boardman (Lab., Leigh) said: <quote>Miners hire a
private coach and fill up the boot with beer cases. People come down
for the Cup Final in coaches carrying more beer bottles than
passengers.</quote> (laughter.)
<head>Ceylon Cabinet Orders General Mobilisation</head>
   <p>THE Ceylon Government today ordered general mobilisation and
called out on active service nine units of volunteers and reservists
of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Home Guards.
   <p>The units were ordered to report for duty immediately. The Prime
Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, said in a broadcast to the
nation today that the Government had received information that various
other organisations besides the recently banned opposition Federal
Party were secretly planning to undermine the Government.
<head>DEATH PENALTY</head>
   <p>The estate strike yesterday morning was aimed at this and
certain elements were using the bank clerks' strike to cause great
economic harm to the country, she declared.
   <p>Mrs. Bandaranaike called upon <quote>all patriotic Ceylonese to give
their full support to the Government.</quote>
   <p>By a proclamation last night, the death penalty for looting and
arson, and other punishment for offences such as the breaking of
bridges, obstruction to roads and damage to buses and trains was
extended to the whole of the island.
   <p>The measures had previously applied only to certain areas
affected by recent trouble in Ceylon, arising out of a civil
disobedience campaign in the Tamil-speaking northern and eastern
provinces against the adoption of Sinhalese as the official language.
<head>London Jew Faces Eichmann After 23 Years</head>
   <p>A BRITISH estate agent, Mr. Moliz Fleischmann, of St.
John's Wood, London, told the court trying Adolf Eichmann, today, of
the occasion 23 years ago when he faced the Nazi leader across a desk
in the Gestapo's Vienna headquarters.
   <p>Mr. Fleischmann, a former Jewish leader in Vienna, where he was
born, escaped on one of the last trains out of the city before the
outbreak of war.
   <p>In March, 1938, he and other Jewish leaders were called to the
Hotel Metropole, Gestapo headquarters, and taken before Eichmann.
   <p><quote>He sat at a large desk &mdash; we had to stand,</quote> Mr. Fleischmann
said. <quote>He was in uniform, the black S.S. uniform which became
very familiar to us later.
   <p><quote>He told us his task was to purify Vienna and Austria from Jews
in the quickest possible way.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Today, as he recalled those words, Mr. Fleischmann again faced
Eichmann. The witness box from which he spoke is directly opposite
the bulletproof glass-covered dock in which Eichmann sat.
   <p><quote>The influence of Eichmann's activity and the fear which
developed in the heart of Viennese Jewry was felt immediately,</quote> said
Mr. Fleischmann.
   <p>Part of Mr. Fleischmann's testimony added to the mystery of
Eichmann's birth. He said that at the Vienna interview Eichmann told
him: <quote>I speak Hebrew and Yiddish fluently because I was born in
Sharona</quote> (a German community near Tel Aviv, Israel).
   <p>But in interrogation Eichmann has told his captors that he was
born at Solingen, Germany, and cannot understand how the idea got
about that he is Palestine-born.
<head>Protest Over Berkswell Footpaths</head>
   <p>THREE Berkswell footpaths and one at Bickenhill, which are
all used by visitors, ramblers and residents in the areas, should not
be closed, Meriden R.D.C. is to tell British Railways.
   <p>Asking for closure orders, British Railways say the footpaths
cross railway lines and will be affected by the Coventry-Birmingham
main line electrification scheme.
   <p>People who live in the neighbourhood and ramblers were asked
their opinion before Meriden R.D.C. came to its decision.
   <p>Berkswell Parish Council strongly opposes any proposal to close
the footpath which runs from the south of Truggist Lane, crossing the
railway line short of the eastern side of Berkswell Station.
<head>ASSOCIATION'S EVIDENCE</head>
   <p>It considered that this path was an important right of way
linking the southern part of the parish with the village and the
church. The Ramblers' Association also confirmed that this path was
used by their Coventry-based clubs.
   <p>The association provided evidence to prove that paths which
linked Kenilworth Road with Wootton Lane and Bradnocks Marsh Lane were
frequently used, although the parish council raised no objections to
closures.
   <p>The closing of a fourth footpath, connecting Old Station Road
with Church Lane, Bickenhill, is being opposed by the local parish
council and the Ramblers' Association.
<head>BILL <squote>GIVES LICENSEES MORE PROTECTION</squote></head>
   <p>COVENTRY and Leamington members of the Midlands Womens'
 Auxiliaries who attended their association's annual rally at
Sutton Coldfield yesterday were told that the new Licensing Bill would
bring more protection from teenage drinkers as well as more competition.
   <p>Nearly 400 wives and relatives of licensees belonging to the
association were at the rally. They are responsible for a great deal
of charity work, both nationally and in the licensed trade.
<head><quote>GOING CONTINENTAL</quote></head>
   <p>They were told by Rear-Admiral W. G. Brittain, director of
the National Trade Development Association, a body which helps to
co-ordinate relations between the brewer and the publican, that under
the new Bill the penalty for under-age drinkers would go up from &pound;2
to &pound;25.
   <p><quote>I hope that will choke off some of them from their games and
give you a more peaceful life in your houses,</quote> he said.
   <p>Rear-Admiral Brittain said the Government had clearly decided
that the country must <quote>go Continental</quote> and give drink licenses to
restaurants and boarding houses. For better or for worse this would
bring competition to the licensed trade.
   <p>He said: <quote>That leads us to the importance of catering, but it
doesn't have to be a <squote>Ritzy</squote> meal.</quote>

<head>200,000 PARISIANS GO WILD OVER KENNEDY</head>
<head>Confetti welcome in Rue \de Rivoli</head>
   <p>PARIS gave President and Mrs. Kennedy a gay welcome today,
and crowds estimated at 200,000 cheered them on their drive from Orly
Airport.
   <p>President \de Gaulle sat beside Mr. Kennedy in an open car as
the American leader &mdash; 26 years his junior &mdash; stood up to acknowledge
the cheers, flag-waving and hand-clapping of the crowds. Surprised
police said there were more people in the streets than for
ex-President Eisenhower or for Mr. Kruschev.
   <p>As soon as the official motorcade entered the city limits a
101-gun salute began to boom out.
   <p>Cannon beside the Seine were still firing as President Kennedy
reached the Quai \d'Orsay, the French Foreign Ministry, where he will
stay until Saturday morning.
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy received a particularly hearty welcome
from students outside the Sorbonne University &mdash; where Mrs. Kennedy
once studied.
   <p>Confetti was showered down the Rue \de Rivoli, where Parisians
thronged office windows as well as pavements.
   <p>At the airport, Mr. Kennedy praised his host as <quote>a captain in
the field in the defence of the West</quote> for over 20 years, adding that
his leadership and sense of history were needed more than ever today.
   <p>It was Mrs. Kennedy who drew the crowds, said police.
   <p>The President stood bare-headed in his car to acknowledge the
cheers, but Mrs. Kennedy, dressed in a pale blue coat and matching
blue straw hat, was half-hidden from the crowds as she rode by in her
enclosed car, waving and smiling.
<head>MEETING</head>
   <p>This three-day visit is President Kennedy's first to Europe
since he took office.
   <p>The first meeting between the Presidents lasted 40 minutes.
   <p>They began their discussions, which will take up nine hours in
five meetings over the next three days, two hours after Mr. Kennedy
flew in.
   <p>General \de Gaulle greeted Mr. Kennedy on the steps of the
Elysee Palace and Republican Guards gave full military honours.
   <p>Later President \de Gaulle gave a luncheon party in the Palace in
honour of Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy.
   <p>The 40 guests included M. Debre, the French Prime Minister.
   <p>Of his planned three-day discussions with President \de Gaulle,
Mr. Kennedy said: <quote>I have neither held nor planned any talks that
are more important.</quote>
   <p>He added: <quote>I am here to pay tribute to France, not for her past
glory but for her present greatness &mdash; her leadership in Europe and
Africa, in science and industry, the productivity of her workers, the
brilliance of her universities, the grandeur of her mission in
carrying the torch of liberty to new nations throughout the world.</quote>
   <p>In his reply, President \de Gaulle told him: <quote>We have never
known Americans here other than as friends and allies, and as such we
welcome you.</quote>
<head>Cheers all the way for President Swart</head>
   <p>THOUSANDS of South Africans, citizens of a republic since
midnight, today saw 66-year-old Mr. Charles Swart drive in
procession to the Groote Kerk Church in Pretoria, where he took the
oath as their first President.
   <p>Representatives of all sections of the population had places in
the church to witness the President's inauguration ceremony.
   <p>They included Africans, Coloureds (mixed race), Indians and
Chinese. Leaders of eight African national units were headed by the
Paramount Chief of the Zulus, Cyprian Dinizulu.
   <p>Mr. Swart drove to church with a guard of mounted police in
front and behind.
   <p>The crowd, six deep in places, cheered him enthusiastically.
Many had waited since 6 a.m. in the rain, and the square was a
sea of umbrellas.
<head>11-gun salute</head>
   <p>Salutes of 11 guns and the peal of church bells greeted the
birth of the republic at midnight, ending ties with the British Crown
that went back 155 years.
   <p>In his inauguration speech, Mr. Swart said South Africa wanted
to decide its own domestic policy <quote>without interference from
outside.</quote>
   <p>He paid tribute to the Queen, expressing appreciation of her
<quote>courtesy, friendliness and graciousness,</quote> and said he hoped for
cordial relations in the future.
   <p>The Queen sent a cable of good wishes, and Mr. Macmillan sent a
message to Dr. Verwoerd, the Prime Minister.
<head>Mr. Kruschev in Czechoslovakia</head>
   <p>Mr. Kruschev arrived today in Czechoslovakia on his way to
the weekend meeting with President Kennedy in Vienna, the Soviet news
agency Tass reported.
   <p>Tass did not name the town in Czechoslovakia where the Soviet
Prime Minister had arrived. Mr. Kruschev left Kiev, in the Ukraine,
by rail.
<head>Conservatives put their man in at hectic meeting</head>
<head>LABOUR OUTVOTED &mdash; SO A TORY GETS THE CHAIR</head>
<head>By MICHAEL PICKERING</head>
<head>Our Municipal Correspondent</head>
   <p>CONSERVATIVE Councillor Bob Henderson was elected chairman of
Newcastle Housing Management Committee today &mdash; but he will hold the
position for only one meeting.
   <p>His election followed a hectic half-hour during the meeting
when the Labour group, with only three members out of ten present,
fought to keep control of the chair.
   <p>They were out-voted by the Conservatives who were at full
strength with five members present.
   <p>Following custom, the Lord Mayor, Ald. Henry Russell, took the
chair at the beginning of the meeting during the election of chairman
and vice-chairman for the coming year.
   <p>The Labour group was represented by Coun. Mrs. C. M.
Lewcock, Coun. A. P. Gurd, and Ald. R. W. Hanlan.
<head>FIVE VOTES TO THREE</head>
   <p>Coun. Mrs. Lewcock proposed Coun. Jack Johnston for
chairman. He is at present on holiday in Paris, and was vice-chairman
last year.
   <p>The Conservatives voted against.
   <p>Coun. Gurd then proposed Coun. Mrs. Lewcock as chairman for
the one meeting.
   <p>Again the Conservatives voted against and won.
   <p>Coun. Bob Henderson then proposed Ald. John Burton, the
former Housing Management Committee chairman, who was voted out of his
chairmanship by the Labour group at a meeting shortly before last
week's aldermanic elections.
   <p>Conservative Councillor Mrs. M. E. Graham seconded the
proposal, but as Ald. Burton was not at the meeting and had not
given his permission, the nomination was withdrawn.
   <p>Conservative Councillor Mrs. I. McCambridge then proposed
Coun. Bob Henderson and the Tories voted him into the chair by five
votes to three.
   <p>Coun. Henderson will remain chairman only for today's meeting,
as members of the opposition party are not entitled to hold the chair
of any Corporation committee, and it is expected that at the next
meeting of the committee the Labour members will arrive in force to
put matters right.
<head>Councillor accuses Labour paper</head>
   <p>COUN. MRS. ETHEL CHALK has protested vigorously against
<quote>misrepresentation of the facts</quote> in the Newcastle Labour Record &mdash; a
news sheet published at the time of the municipal elections.
   <p><quote>In this paper,</quote> she says, <quote>the Socialists say they built the
Mary Magdalen home for old people.
   <p><quote>The home was built by the Schools and Charities Committee with
money left to the City.</quote>
   <p>The sentence in the paper reads: <quote>We have built old people's
homes such as the Mary Magdalen homes.</quote>
   <p>Mrs. Chalk also complains that the paper stated that the
Welfare Committee would complete two new homes for the elderly during
1961.
   <p><quote>I challenged this statement at this week's meeting of the
Welfare Committee,</quote> she said <quote>and the chairman was forced to admit
that neither of the new homes would be open until next year.</quote>
<head>COMIC-STRIP PARIS SEND-OFF</head>
<head>Smiles, handshake as K. and K. meet</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY, young leader of the West, today shook
hands with Premier Nikita Kruschev, wily, experienced leader of the
Communist bloc, in neutral Vienna.
   <p>Mr. Kennedy was smiling, Mr. Kruschev beaming, as they met
for the first time on the steps of the American Ambassador's home.
   <p>As they grasped hands at the top of the nine stone steps leading
to the residence door, Mr. Kennedy said to his interpreter: <quote>Ask
him if it would be all right to shake hands again for the
photographers.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Kruschev agreed, and they vigorously shook hands again.
   <p>Then they went inside to the white-walled music room to begin
their first talks &mdash; over lunch.
<head>CHEERS</head>
   <p>As President Kennedy drove from the airport, people stood and
cheered in the rain.
   <p>Some carried banners reading <quote>Help Berlin.</quote> One said:
<quote>Give him hell, Jack.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Kruschev drove into the grounds of the residence in a black
Zil limousine with his Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, about 25
minutes after Mr. Kennedy and his Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk.
   <p>After lunch, the talks were to continue until 6 p.m. round a
coffee table in a small room furnished in red and grey in early
American style.
   <p>Mrs. Kennedy reached the residence earlier at the head of
another convoy of cars, having driven direct from the airport.
<head>COMIC STRIP</head>
   <p>A series of comic-strip mishaps frustrated President Kennedy's
attempts to leave Paris. Eventually his aircraft took off &mdash; a quarter
of an hour behind schedule.
   <p>First the CAR carrying Mr. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State,
broke down on the way to the airport. It was pushed off the road and
another one was produced, but the party was ten minutes late reaching
the airport.
   <p>Then just as the Presidential jet was about to taxi on to the
runway another group of the party rushed on to the tarmac and a packet
of NEWSPAPERS was also thrown aboard.
   <p>At last the plane's doors were again closed and it taxied off.
But then a massive American SECRET SERVICE MAN ran after it,
gesticulating and shouting for it to stop.
   <p>He was breathlessly followed by Providencia, Mrs. Kennedy's
COLOURED MAID, who had apparently got left behind while she
searched for a lost suitcase.
<head>THE MAID</head>
   <p>No sooner was Providencia on board than yet another late-comer
was seen running across the tarmac. It was <quote>Tish,</quote> Mrs.
Kennedy's SOCIAL SECRETARY, Miss Letitia Baldridge.
   <p>Then, with all passengers apparently aboard, the jet finally got
under way for Vienna.
   <p>There were cries of ~<quote>Goodbye Jackie</quote> and ~<quote>Goodbye Madame</quote>
as Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a light blue woollen overcoat, a white
straw hat and gloves, walked towards the aircraft just behind the
President.
   <p>With them were M. Debre, the French Prime Minister, M.
Maurice Couve \de Murville, Foreign Minister, and the Austrian
Ambassador, Herr Adria Rotter.
<head>New Summit? Mac and Kennedy weigh up chances</head>
<head>By JOSEPH TOBIN, Our Political Correspondent.</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN and President Kennedy today considered the
next critical steps towards a full Summit conference of the major
powers.
   <p>With Summit diplomacy revived in a spectacular fashion by the
Vienna meeting with Mr. Kruschev, the President considered with the
Prime Minister the chances of a meeting of the Big Four soon.
   <p>This was the highlight of the review of East-West relations in
the meeting between the President and the Prime Minister.
   <p>The talks lasted for three hours. This was a surprise, for they
had only been scheduled to last two hours.
   <p>But it is understood that the Prime Minister and the President
extended their meeting to consider fully Mr. Kruschev's tough
attitude on several major questions at the Vienna meeting.
   <p>The Russians are said to be taking up a tougher attitude on many
problems, particularly on Berlin.
   <p>There was complete agreement between the Premier and the
President on the West's policy concerning Berlin.
   <p>The two men met alone in the Prime Minister's study at Admiralty
House.
<head>ARRIVED EARLY</head>
   <p>The President surprised the Prime Minister's staff by arriving
ten minutes early for the talks.
   <p>In their man-to-man exchanges they also considered the situation
in Laos.
   <p>Above all, they considered the future of <quote>Summitry.</quote> They had
to answer the question: <quote>Does the Vienna meeting, with its vague
goodwill, but no practical results, justify further steps along the
same road.</quote>
<head>COMMON MARKET</head>
   <p>The President also reported on Mr. Kruschev's attitude to
nuclear testing and disarmament. All reports are that Mr. Kruschev
was unyielding on these two issues.
   <p>It is understood that Mr. Macmillan also questioned the
President on his earlier talks with President \de Gaulle. This
meeting may have a crucial bearing on Britain's possible entry into
the common market.
<head>AT THE PALACE</head>
   <p>This evening the Premier and President will issue a communique
on their talks.
   <p>Tonight the Kennedys will go to Buckingham Palace for dinner with
the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

<head>WATER GUNS HOSE BERLINERS ON BORDER</head>
<head>U.S. troops threatened in a second incident</head>
   <p>East German police to-day shot streams of water at West
Berliners standing within 100yds. of the border, on the Western
side, West Berlin police reported.
   <p>The East German Interior Ministry on Tuesday told West
Berliners to keep 100yds. from the borders. The Western
commandants, ordering Allied troops up to the border yesterday,
described this as <quote>effrontery.</quote>
   <p>In another incident, an East German police officer to-day called
on American soldiers standing just behind the sector border
demarcation line to withdraw, and when the Americans did not move a
water cannon lorry drove up on the East Berlin side, a West German
News Agency reported. But after a while the water hose was withdrawn
with the Americans still in position.
   <p>East Berlin police last night threw several tear gas grenades
into a group of 40 West Berliners listening to a West Berlin
loudspeaker van which had drawn up close to the border to broadcast
news.
   <p>Winds blew the tear gas back across the border and someone in the
crowd threw one of the grenades back, a police spokesman said.
<head><quote>Showing flag</quote></head>
   <p>Meanwhile British, American and French troops, backed by tanks,
to-day stood guard along the city's dividing line.
   <p>The troops took station yesterday along the city sector boundary
after the East German Government introduced stringent new regulations
for passage from one half of the city to the other.
   <p>They remained on guard all night, and to-day British forces, with
tanks and armoured cars, took part in their second <quote>show-the-flag</quote>
exercise in three days.
   <p>The Dutch and Swedish consulates in Berlin said to-day they had
received reports that foreign residents in East Germany were having
difficulties in leaving the territory.
   <p>In East Berlin, Foreign Ministry officials said they had not
heard of any new regulations banning foreigners from going to West
Berlin.
<head>Offices shut</head>
   <p>No offices of the East German travel agency were opened in West
Berlin to-day <quote>because the West Berlin City Government refused
permission,</quote> an East German railway official said.
   <p>Moscow Radio said in an English-language broadcast beamed at
Britain that ~<quote>Whitehall is playing a dangerous game with fire across
a powder magazine</quote> over the Berlin issue.
   <p><quote>Such deeds are fraught with the danger of a military
catastrophe in which Britain, too, would be involved,</quote> said the
broadcast.
<head>THREAT TO AIR CORRIDOR <squote>SERIOUS</squote></head>
   <p>Britain would regard any threat to the air communications with
Berlin as <quote>an extremely serious matter,</quote> said a Foreign Office
spokesman in London to-day.
   <p>He had been asked about the Berlin air corridors which, it is
understood, are referred to in the new Soviet Note on the Berlin
situation. He would not, however, make any official comment on the
Note itself.
   <p>It is understood that the references on the air corridors
introduces  a new element into the situation, writes a
diplomatic correspondent.
<head>Being studied</head>
   <p>The full text of the Note was received by the Foreign Office
to-day from the British Embassy in Moscow. Similar Notes have been
delivered to the United States and French Governments.
   <p>The Notes are being studied by the three Western powers and will
also be discussed by the ambassadorial steering group in Washington,
on which Britain, the U.S., France and West Germany are
represented.
   <p>According to the Soviet news agency Tass &mdash; quoted by Reuter &mdash; the
Soviet Government have protested in the Notes against the use of the
air corridors to West Berlin for <quote>subversive and revenge-seeking aims
of West German militarists.</quote>
<head><quote>Provocative</quote></head>
   <p>The Notes demanded that the Western powers take <quote>immediate
measures to end the unlawful and provocative activities</quote> of the West
German Government in West Berlin.
   <p>The Notes also said there had been <quote>a flagrant breach of the
agreement reached in 1945 under which air corridors were set aside for
the three Western powers, on a temporary basis, to ensure the needs of
their military garrisons, and not for subversive and revanchist
purposes of West German militarism.</quote>
   <p>Russia insisted that the Western powers <quote>take immediate measures
to put an end to the unlawful and provocative actions of the Federal
German Republic in West Berlin.</quote>
<head>ROW FLARES AT BERLIN STATION</head>
<head>But Premier optimistic</head>
   <p>Tension in Berlin soared again to-day with angry protests over
travel restrictions imposed by the East Germans and a threat by the
West of <quote>necessary action.</quote>
   <p>On the brighter side, Mr. Macmillan gave an impromptu news
conference on the Gleneagles golf course and said he thought no-one
would fight over Berlin, and Mr. Khrushchev was quoted as saying
that he was willing to talk over the difficulties.
   <p>The East German restriction which caused to-day's trouble
concerned the issuing of permits for West Berliners wishing to travel
to the East on the overhead railway.
   <p>The Western Commandants authorised the City Government to take
<quote>necessary action</quote> against the issuing of permits.
   <p>Angry West Berliners, shouting, ~<quote>Get out, you pigs,</quote>
gathered outside the Zoo railway station to-day after the East German
officials who run it started issuing permits.
   <p>Six policemen kept the crowd of 50 to 60 people at a distance,
but one woman who went up to the ticket window to get an application
form for a permit was spat on by a fellow West Berliner.
<head>Offices shut</head>
   <p>Finally the office was shut, along with a similar office at
Westkureuz Station.
   <p>The U.S. Commandant in Berlin has made an oral protest to
his Soviet counterpart <quote>concerning the illegal regulations issued by
East German authorities in recent days and incidents arising
therefrom.</quote>
   <p>The 1st Battalion the Welch Regiment  increased patrols
on the border between the British sector of West Berlin and East
Germany to-day to counter increased East German activity on the other
side.
   <p>Mr. Macmillan, who is holidaying in Scotland, spoke to
reporters on the 18th fairway of the golf course. He declared:
<quote>Berlin is one of those things we have to be careful about &mdash; that
nobody does anything foolish.
<head><squote>Risk of folly</squote></head>
   <p><quote>I think there would be much more danger of war if weapons
were not so destructive. Fifty years ago we could have had a war.
Now it is not much fun for anybody.
   <p><quote>But there is always the danger of folly. I think the way it is
going on is very worrying, but nothing more.</quote>
   <p>To-morrow Mr. Macmillan is to discuss the Berlin situation with
Lord Home, the Foreign Secretary, at Gleneagles. It was learned
to-day that Lord Home will afterwards go to stay privately with Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother at Birkhall.
   <p>In Copenhagen, Drew Pearson, syndicated American newspaper
columnist, said that Mr. Krushchev had told him he was willing to
meet Western leaders <quote>as soon as possible.</quote>
<head><squote>Strongest protest</squote> over Caldon Canal closure plan</head>
<head>URGENT MATTER, SAY CHEADLE R.D.C.</head>
   <p>Cheadle Rural Council's Town Planning and Plans Committee
decided yesterday to protest <quote>in the strongest possible terms</quote>
against the proposal to close part of the Caldon Canal between
Hazelhurst New Locks and Froghall. Later the full council endorsed
this step <quote>as a matter of urgency.</quote>
   <p>At their last meeting the committee were told by the Deputy
Area Planning Officer, Mr. B. Skelland, that it was planned
eventually to <quote>reintegrate</quote> that section of the canal with the
adjoining land.
   <p>Yesterday the committee were informed that the proposal to close
the canal had been made by the British Transport Commission to the
Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee.
   <p>In a letter, the Inland Waterways Protection Society told the
committee that in the case of each threatened canal, they carried out
an inspection of every yard of the waterway and eventually submitted a
scheme to the Redevelopment Committee showing how the canal under
review could, if properly managed, be made to pay its way.
   <p>Claiming that their schemes had always been ignored, the society
maintained that all details concerning the closing of the Caldon
Branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal were worked out years ago and
were one further step towards the <quote>elimination</quote> of the inland
waterways.
   <p>The society pointed out that the present capital value of the
Caldon Canal was in the region of &pound;20 millions.
<head><quote>Alarmed</quote></head>
   <p>It was also reported that the Service of Youth Scheme and
Kingsley and Ipstones Parish Council were unanimously opposed to the
proposed closure of the canal.
   <p>The Froghall firm of Thomas Bolton and Sons Ltd., said they
were <quote>alarmed</quote> at the possibility of the canal being closed, and
the elimination of the water-feed from the canal to their works would
have <quote>extremely serious consequences</quote> and might result in the
closing of much plant unless satisfactory alternatives were provided.
   <p>Another firm affected by the proposed closure, W. Podmore and
Sons Ltd., of Shelton, who have a factory at Consall, pointed out
that any extraction of water would seriously affect their interests.
   <p>Brittains Ltd., of Cheddleton Paper Mills, said their own use
of the canal had diminished over the years, and if the time came for
disposal of parts of the canal, they would be very interested in
considering the purchase of that portion which lay alongside their
factory.
   <p>The Chairman of the Planning Committee, Mr. J. H. Aberley,
recommended that the council should protest most strongly against the
closure. He pointed out that the council were not in a position to
put in a piped water supply to factories.
<head><quote>Lifeblood</quote></head>
   <p>Mr. T. P. Brindley suggested that firms taking water
from the canal should be asked to contribute towards its upkeep.
Instead of thinking of closing the canal, he said, steps should be
taken to find out if the silt could be removed and the canal restored
to its full industrial use, particularly as the railway was now closed
to passenger traffic.
   <p>Mr. F. R. Ford commented: <quote>It is time this country spent
a bit more money on canals. They are the lifeblood of some countries,
and they can still do a lot for this country.</quote> He suggested that
the money for <quote>reintegrating</quote> the canal with the adjoining land
would be better spent in cleaning it up and making it usable again.</quote>
<head>BERLIN PUTS BLANKET ON BOMB TALKS</head>
<head>British effort at Geneva</head>
   <p>Mr. David Ormsby-Gore, leader of the British delegation at
the Geneva conference on the banning of nuclear tests, which started
to-day, said before leaving London Airport: <quote>I am not very
optimistic in the present climate.</quote>
   <p>Former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he added: <quote>But
we mean to make a real effort to get the Russians moving again in
these negotiations.</quote>
   <p>He added that it would probably be his last attendance at the
talks before taking up his fresh post as Britain's Ambassador in
Washington in October.
   <p>Mr. Ormsby-Gore, asked if he was hopeful of a solution being
found in view of the Berlin crisis, said: <quote>I think the general
political atmosphere is not conducive to progress in any negotiations
with the Soviet Union at the present time.
   <p><quote>I do not say it has eliminated any hope of settlement, but
clearly the Soviet Union do not appear at the moment to be very
interested in reaching any agreements with the West.</quote>
<head>Deadlock</head>
   <p>Asked if the deadlock was likely to continue in the talks, he
said: <quote>I do not know at all. It will depend upon the instructions
Mr. Tsarapkin (the Russian delegate) has brought back with him from
Moscow.</quote>
   <p>In the talks, the West were making yet another determined bid to
try to get a nuclear test ban treaty with Russia.
   <p>The U.S. delegation, led by Mr. Arthur Dean, are under
instructions from President Kennedy to make the maximum effort to
reach agreement with Russia. The talks began three years ago and have
been deadlocked for the past five months.
   <p>Diplomatic observers said the biggest obstacle to agreement was
the Soviet <quote>Troika</quote> proposal, demanding that the International
Control Organisation, which would <quote>police</quote> a test ban, should be
headed by three administrators &mdash; one each from the Communist, Western
and neutral groups &mdash; instead of one.

<head>CLR. BROOK BECOMES HUDDERSFIELD'S 61st MAYOR</head>
<head>A momentous year in prospect</head>
   <p>CLR. HARRY FRANCE BROOK became Huddersfield's sixty-first
Mayor and was also elected an alderman at the annual meeting of the
Town Council this afternoon.
   <p>Ald. Brook has been a Liberal representative for the Birkby
Ward since 1944. He is chairman of directors and founder of the firm
of Messrs. H. F. Brook and Co. Ltd., woollen merchants and
clothiers, St. John's Road, Huddersfield. His daughter, Mrs. Jean
W. Nicholson, is the new Mayoress.
   <p>More than 1,500 flowers and potted plants, delicately arranged by
the Corporation Parks Department staff, provided a brilliant
background for the Town Hall ceremony.
   <p>Ald. Day, the retiring Mayor, presided over the ceremony. He
and Mrs. Day are to serve as the Deputy Mayor and Mayoress.
   <p>Clr. A. J. Hazelden, moving the resolution to elect Clr.
Brook, said: <quote>The name of Brook has for scores of years been
associated with Huddersfield, and for nearly the lifetime of the
county borough since its incorporation 1868 there has been a Brook a
member of this Council.
   <p><quote>Our new Mayor will be the fifth of that name in the long
history of Huddersfield,</quote> he went on.
   <p>Clr. Hazelden said that Brook was a good old Anglo-Saxon
name &mdash; and one with two meanings. The first meaning &mdash; that of
<quote>stream</quote> &mdash; was appropriate having regard to the number of Brooks
who had served the Council today and in the past. The second
meaning &mdash; <quote>to suffer insult or injury</quote> &mdash; would, they all sincerely
hoped, not be the lot of the Mayor-elect!
   <p>Clr. Brook began his education in two of the local schools.
   <p>As a boy and a man his interests had covered a very wide field &mdash;
he (Clr. Hazelden) understood that in the world of sport,
particularly, the new Mayor had shown considerable ability as a
footballer and a cricketer and, more latterly, as a bowler.
   <p>His work on the Council over the many years of his service had
been outstanding in more than one respect.
   <p><quote>Among the many committees of which he has been a member it
cannot be said that his sincerity and purpose have been lacking in any
degree,</quote> said Clr. Hazelden.
   <p>Clr. Hazelden went on to refer to the various committees on
which Clr. Brook served &mdash; including the Children's Committee, of
which he was Chairman, the Watch Committee of which he was also
Chairman, and the Mental Health Sub-Committee of the Health Committee.
<head>Desire to <quote>play the game</quote></head>
   <p><quote>All of us know the remarks made about the Watch Committee &mdash;
and they are not always too kind,</quote> said Clr. Hazelden.
   <p><quote>The source of law and order is not always very popular, but is
still very essential, and Clr. Brook, the chairman, has a knowledge
of police administration not only locally but nationally, for he was a
member of the Police Committee of the Association of Municipal
Corporations and a representative on the Police Training College
Board.</quote>
   <p>Clr. Brook saw to it that certain minimum standards were
conformed with and no-one could deny his fairness. <quote>His views,
although not accepted, are in accordance with the earnest desire &mdash; be
it in the civic field of duty or on the field of sport &mdash; to <squote>play the
game.</squote></quote>
   <p>The new civic year could be a momentous one for Huddersfield.
It might well be that the foundations of the <quote>new Huddersfield</quote>
would be laid, and never before had such tremendous innovations and
plans for the future been contemplated.
   <p>Not only were the Council there to acknowledge the new Mayor,
said Clr. Hazelden, but for the second time in Huddersfield's long
history they were to honour their new Mayor with an aldermanic seat.
   <p>Clr. Hazelden recalled that in 1873, when Clr. Henry Brook
was elected Mayor, he too was made an alderman at the same time.
   <p>Clr. Hazelden's election motion was supported by Clrs. Mrs.
R. Townsend and C. C. Hoyle.
   <p>Clr. Mrs. Townsend said that people should be grateful that
men of Clr. Brook's calibre and business acumen gave their services
to the community.
<head>Severe test of stamina</head>
   <p>Clr. Hoyle said that a Mayor's life was a severe test of
physical and moral stamina. The year of office was filled to capacity
with deputations, speeches, receptions and many other duties &mdash;
including about 700 meetings concerned with Council affairs.
   <p>Notwithstanding this terrific strain, the Mayors impressed
everyone not only by their ability but by their strength of character
and sincerity of thought.
   <p>Clr. Brook possessed those qualities in high degree. <quote>Here is
someone whose friendship is a possession to be cherished,</quote> Clr.
Hoyle added.
   <p>On his return to the Council meeting attired in the Mayoral
robes, and after taking the oath of office, the new Mayor thanked the
Council for the honour they had accorded to him. He was very proud to
be Mayor of his native town &mdash; a town for which he had a great
affection. He was proud of Huddersfield's name in municipal
government. <quote>We who serve on the Town Council have our critics,</quote>
Clr. Brook continued. <quote>While criticism of a constructive kind is
good, I have little patience with he who praises with enthusiastic
tone all centuries but this, and every town but his own.</quote>
   <p>All members of the Council, irrespective of their political
views, were animated by the desire to make Huddersfield worthy of its
citizens. It was true to say of everyone entering local government &mdash;
not least a mayor &mdash; that he or she became a visionary.
<head>More delectable place</head>
   <p><quote>I have a vision of Huddersfield of the not-too-distant future
when the great schemes, some already nearing completion, have come to
fruition,</quote> the Mayor continued.
   <p><quote>Huddersfield will then be a more delectable place.</quote>
   <p>After listing the various developments the Mayor said that all
these were necessary schemes that could only be carried out at cost
and some inconvenience. It was important, therefore, that they should
take the public into their confidence and seek their support for these
latest efforts in municipal enterprise.
   <p>In many of the functions of a local authority it was not enough
that a task should be done efficiently, but that it must also be done
sympathetically.
   <p>Impersonality and coldness would alienate and repel, however
impressive the achievement, and however faultless the organisation.
   <p>Speaking of the fact that his daughter would be undertaking the
duties of Mayoress, Clr. Brook stressed the point that she would
seek to combine her official duties with those of having to run a home
and a very young family. He hoped that the demands made on her during
working hours would not be too great.
   <p>He concluded: <quote>I am very conscious of the confidence you have
reposed in me and I trust that when, a year hence, the time comes for
me to surrender my regalia of office, I shall be able to pass it on
unsullied to my successor, and you will feel that that confidence was
not misplaced.</quote>
<head>Put Huddersfield on the map</head>
   <p>A vote of thanks to the retiring Mayor was proposed by Clr.
E. L. Thackray and supported by Clrs. D. Sisson and B.
M. Schofield.
   <p>Clr. Thackray said that their warmest thanks were due to Ald.
and Mrs. Day, who had not spared themselves in carrying out their
duties.
   <p>Ald. Day had lost no opportunity of <quote>selling Huddersfield</quote>
on official visits, and he had put Huddersfield on the map with
dignity. He himself had always remained a very likeable person, and
had presided efficiently over Council meetings.
   <p>Clr. Sisson spoke of the fine co-operation Ald. Day had had
from his employers, Messrs. Thomas Broadbent and Sons Ltd.,
engineers, which had enabled him to perform all his Mayoral duties.
   <p>Clr. Schofield remarked that he had served under Ald. Day's
chairmanship on the Markets and Fairs Committee all the time that he
(Clr. Schofield) had been on the Council. He praised the valuable
work Ald. Day had done during his long association with that
committee.
<head>People <quote>made us feel at home</quote></head>
   <p>Ald. Day said in reply that he and the retiring Mayoress had
had the feeling during their period of office that they were the heads
of a <quote>large and united family.</quote>
   <p><quote>The people of Huddersfield, of all ages, classes, creeds and
colour, have made us feel at home and welcome on all occasions. We
look back with very happy memories on the year which is now
passing.</quote>
   <p>Ald. Day recalled that twelve months ago he expressed the
hope that during his Mayoralty he would see much of the old property
in the town demolished and derelict sites made more presentable.
   <p><quote>I venture to say that since that day there have never been
more buildings pulled down and new ones put up in any one year of our
lifetime,</quote> he told the Council.
   <p><quote>I think it can truly be said that Huddersfield is
experiencing the biggest <squote>face-lift</squote> in its history, and the boom
in new buildings and road construction indicates <squote>full steam ahead</squote>
for a long time to come.</quote>
   <p>Ald. Day paid tribute to the Mayoress for her support and also
thanked the Deputy Mayor and Mayoress (Clr. and Mrs. F. Lawton),
the Town Clerk (Mr. H. Bann), the Mayor's Secretary (Mr. W.
Stoney) and other Corporation officials for their assistance.
<head>DISAGREEMENT OVER ELECTION OF TWO ALDERMEN</head>
<head>Labour protest by not voting</head>
   <p>LABOUR councillors at this afternoon's meeting of
Huddersfield Town Council made it clear beforehand that they would
abstain from voting on the matter of the elevation to the aldermanic
bench of two former members defeated at the polls in the recent
Municipal Elections.
   <p>In addition to the Mayor, the two defeated councillors at the
elections &mdash; Mr. Clifford Stephenson (Lib.) and Mr. F. W.
Fielding (Con.) &mdash; had been nominated as new aldermen to fill the
places of Ald. C. Hickson and Ald. G. E. Tomlinson
(retiring) and a seat vacated by Labour.
   <p>Aldermen J. F. C. Cole, J. T. Gee, H. A. Bennie
Gray, N. Day and Mrs. M. L. Middlebrook Haigh were being
nominated for a further term of six years.
   <p>The elevation of Clr. Brook creates a by-election in Birkby
ward.
   <p>News of Labour's abstention came in a statement to <quote>The
Examiner</quote> by Clr. Reginald Hartley, leader of the Labour group on
the Council, before he went into the annual meeting. He and his
colleagues, he said, had decided to support the majority of aldermanic
proposals, but would not support the election of Messrs. Stephenson
and Fielding.
<head><quote>Opposed in principle</quote></head>
   <p>The statement read:
<quote>
   <p>The Labour group on the Council are opposed in principle to the
election of persons to the office of alderman from outside the elected
representatives to the Council.
   <p>We fully appreciate that such elections are legally admissible,
and that in fact such elections have been made from time to time by
all parties in various towns and cities of this country. Nevertheless
we feel that it is contrary to our democratic principles to elect
people to the office of alderman, enabling them to have equal rights
in the government of our town with those persons who have been
democratically elected as councillors by the votes of the people.
   <p>Indeed, we had every reason to believe that this principle would
be accepted by all parties on the Council in view of the fact that, by
signed agreement between the parties concerning the filling of
aldermanic vacancies, such vacancies should be filled from the elected
representatives at the time in proportion to party strength &mdash; the
exception being that when, for some special reason, a nomination is
made from outside elected representatives, this should only be done by
agreement among all parties.
<head><quote>We shall refrain</quote></head>
   <p>We therefore feel that by the nominations on this occasion both
Liberal and Conservative Parties have violated the spirit of such
agreement in addition to the principle of democratic election by the
people.
   <p>Therefore on this occasion we intend to support the election of
the nominees of the Liberal and Conservative parties who are members
at the time of election but we shall refrain from supporting the two
nominees who are not members of this authority.

<head>TRUJILLO: A SUSPECT AND PRIEST HELD</head>
   <p>THE Dominican Government announced today it had taken into

together with a priest accused of harbouring him on the night of the
murder.
   <p>The suspect was identified as Huascar Tejeda Reina and his
alleged protector as Father Gabriel Maduro.
   <p>Still at large are Gen. Juan Diaz, retired, who is said to be
the chief assassin, and at least four alleged accomplices &mdash; his

   <p>Police said Tejeda admitted he was at the priest's house on the
night of the killing, but denied any part in the murder. Father

<head>K. meets K. round a coffee table in Vienna</head>
   <p>THE two most powerful men in the world met round a coffee
table in a small cosily-furnished Vienna music room today for talks on
East-West issues which may shape the destinies of millions of people
throughout the world.
   <p>President John Kennedy, 44 last Monday and in power only four
months, met Mr. Kruschev, who at 67, has wielded supreme power in
the Soviet Union for four years.
   <p>These two men of vastly different backgrounds &mdash; a millionaire and
the other the revolutionary son of a coal-miner &mdash; will meet for a
total of 10 hours to size each other up.
   <p>The two men met at the American Ambassador's residence on the
outskirts of the city shortly after President Kennedy flew in from
Paris with his wife after his talks with President De Gaulle.
<head>Range</head>
   <p>Mrs. Kruschev is also in Vienna &mdash; she spent some time this
morning at an art gallery.
   <p>Tomorrow the two men will meet again.
   <p>The two leaders will discuss a wide range of world problems,
although both have made clear there will be no negotiations.
   <p>Mr. Kruschev said when he arrived in Vienna that he wanted to
make personal contact with Mr. Kennedy and to discuss the main
issues in Soviet-American relations.
   <p>Mr. Kennedy came to Vienna to try to find out from Mr.
Kruschev whether any progress could be made in the stalled Geneva
conferences &mdash; on Laos and on a nuclear weapons test ban treaty.
<head>For the man of the moment, another grand hand...</head>
   <p>LONDON gave President Kennedy another big hand to-day when he
left Buckingham Place, the home of his wife's sister.
   <p>For his part, the President was in genial form (left).
   <p>The enthusiasm was renewed when he later went to Admiralty House
for talks and lunch with Mr. Macmillan.

<head>KENNEDY, MAC LOOK AHEAD TO NEW SUMMIT</head>
<head>They weigh up value of Vienna talks</head>
<head>By JOSEPH TOBIN</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN and President Kennedy today considered the next
steps towards a full summit conference of the major Powers.
   <p>The Summit diplomacy revived in a spectacular fashion by the
Vienna meeting with Mr. Kruschev. President Kennedy considered with
Mr. Macmillan the chances of a meeting of the Big Four soon.
   <p>This was the highlight of a two-hour review of East-West
relations in the meeting between the President and the Prime Minister.
   <p>The two men met alone in the Prime Minister's study in Admiralty
House. From this first floor room overlooking Whitehall they could
see the crowds waiting to greet Mrs. Kennedy as she joined the men
and other guests for lunch.
<head>CONTRAST</head>
   <p>This meeting between the two Western leaders in the room
normally used by the First Lord of the Admiralty &mdash; the Prime Minister
is using it while 10, Downing Street is being rebuilt &mdash; is in contrast
to the opulent surroundings in which the President met Mr. Kruschev
in Vienna.
   <p>The President surprised the Prime Minister's staff by arriving
10 minutes early for the talks.
   <p>Behind the spectacle of the cheering crowds in the sunshine
there were a number of queries hanging over President Kennedy's report
to Mr. Macmillan on the talks with Mr. Kruschev.
   <p>In their man-to-man exchanges they considered the future policy
on Berlin &mdash; on which differences of opinion between Britain and the
U.S. are reported &mdash; and the situation in Laos and Mr.
Kruschev's reaction to this.
   <p>Above all, they considered the future of <quote>summitry.</quote> They
had to answer the question: <quote>Does the Vienna meeting, with its vague
good-will but no practical results, justify further steps along the
same road.</quote>
   <p>President Kennedy also reported on Mr. Kruschev's attitude to
nuclear testing and disarmament. All reports are that Mr. Kruschev
was unyielding on these issues.
   <p>It is understood that Mr. Macmillan also questioned the
President on his earlier talks with President \de Gaulle. This
meeting may have a crucial bearing on Britain's possible entry into
the Common Market.
   <p>President Kennedy has been attempting to use his good office to
this end.
   <p>Among the prominent guests at the lunch at Admiralty House were
the Foreign Secretary, Lord Home, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.
Selwyn Lloyd, and the new British Ambassador to the United States,
Mr. David Ormsby-Gore.
   <p>Tonight President and Mrs. Kennedy go to Buckingham Palace for
dinner with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh.
   <p>It was expected that a communique on today's talks would be
issued later today.
   <p>The U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Rusk, was <quote>not
encouraging</quote> in his view of the Kennedy-Kruschev weekend talks,
according to reports in Paris.
<head>MAC KEEPS SILENT ON TALKS WITH KENNEDY</head>
   <p>MR. MACMILLAN refused to be drawn when answering questions
in the Commons this afternoon on his talks with President Kennedy
yesterday.
   <p>He had nothing to add to the communique which was issued after
the talks, he said.
   <p><quote>Mr. Kennedy wished to have a private conversation with me and
it was agreed it should be private,</quote> the Prime Minister continued.
<quote>If I were to publish afterwards what we said to each other it would
not be private.</quote>
   <p>He added: <quote>I do not think it would be in the public interest
for me to make a detailed statement on the specific points raised.</quote>
   <p><quote>The British and U.S. administrations are in constant touch
on these matters.

<head>WORTLEY PUT THEIR CASE AGAINST CITY <squote>TAKEOVER</squote></head>
   <p>REPRESENTATIVES of Wortley Rural Council today met the Local
Government Commission in London to discuss the proposals of other
authorities affecting the rural district.
   <p>Wortley are very much concerned about Sheffield's proposals,
which could reduce the population of the rural district by more than
40 per cent and the rateable value by more than 22 per cent.
<head>3,600 HOUSES</head>
   <p>Sheffield, whose case is based on housing grounds, are seeking
to extend their boundaries to take in part of the Ecclesfield and
Bradfield parishes.
   <p>If successful, they would take into the city more than 3,000
houses which they have built in the Parson Cross area, and more than
600 Wortley council houses, as well as eight schools, a clinic and two
parks.
   <p>Wortley Council have offered to buy all Sheffield Corporation
houses built in the rural district and to administer them as part of
their own housing programme.
<head>OTHER PURPOSES</head>
   <p>Concerning Bradfield parish, Sheffield proposes substantial
Corporation housing at Stannington adjoining existing development,
partly private and partly the Rural Council's.
   <p>Rotherham Corporation are seeking to take into their boundary
that part of Thorpe Hesley which is in Wortley district.
<head>Councils agree to merger plan</head>
   <p>Three of four local authorities concerned in a merger plan for
local government re-organisation in the Barnsley area have agreed to
the scheme.
   <p>They are Penistone Rural and Dodworth and Penistone Urban
Councils. The fourth authority, Stocksbridge Urban Council, are to
discuss the plan this month.
   <p>The scheme will probably be put forward by the West Riding County
Council during discussions with the Local Government Boundaries
Commission in London next month. The four districts have a combined
population of about 30,000.

<head>BRITAIN HITS BACK AS MR K ACCUSES</head>
<head>Reds turn on the heat over Berlin</head>
<head>By JOSEPH TOBIN</head>
   <p>BRITAIN is to give a short and sharp rebuff to Mr. Kruschev's
latest attempt to stir up an international crisis over West Berlin.
   <p>The British Government is to reject out of hand the Russian
complaint that W. Berlin is being used for the organisation of
<quote>international provocations endangering peace.</quote>
   <p>The Foreign Secretary, Lord Home, is preparing his reply to
Russia's complaint. The terms of the reply are expected to be
delivered late tonight.
   <p>The cause of the present clash with the Russians is the decision
of the West Germans to hold Parliamentary committee meetings in Berlin
and a session next week of the Federal Parliament's upper house there.
<head>REJECTED</head>
   <p>The West German President, Herr Luebke, today rejected the
Russian complaints. Lord Home's reply will be on similar lines.
   <p>The Russians have protested to the United States, France, and
Britain at <quote>unlawful</quote> meetings of the West German Parliamentary
committees in West Berlin.
   <p>I understand that the Foreign Secretary will say in his reply
to Mr. Kruschev that Britain does not think these meetings are
against the four-Power status of the city.
   <p>He will remind Mr. Kruschev that similar meetings have been
held in the past.
<head>SURPRISED</head>
   <p>Although President Kennedy described his talks on Germany and
Berlin with the Soviet leader as <quote>most sombre</quote> observers were
surprised today that Russia should raise the Berlin issue with the
Western powers so quickly after the Vienna meeting.
   <p>Meanwhile, Western delegates fear that Mr. Andrei Gromyko,
the Russian Foreign Minister, has returned empty-handed to the Geneva
international conference on Laos, which is in danger of completely
breaking down over the question of a ceasefire.
   <p>In Vienna, Mr. Kruschev had acknowledged the importance of an
effective cease-fire in Laos.

<head>TO CONTEST WOOD DITTON STAKES</head>
<head>Pinturischio Has Impressed</head>
<head>By OLD ROWLEY</head>
<head>NEWMARKET, Thursday.</head>
   <p>PINTURISCHIO is expected to make his long-awaited debut in
the Wood Ditton Stakes at our Craven meeting a week today. Even
though he has not been seriously tried at home, let alone raced, this
colt whom Noel Murless trains for Sir Victor Sassoon, is already
ante-post favourite for the Derby.
   <p>On Saturday morning, Pinturischio did his most informative work
to date, but it would be presumptuous to say that observers were left
a great deal wiser as to his ability. The gallop took place over a
mile on the Racecourse Side, where he was accompanied by Aurelius
(Lester Piggott), Hunter's Song and Magnificat, three other maidens.
   <p>Throughout most of the trip Pinturischio was held up about a
length behind his workmates, who were galloping in line abreast. Then
with half a furlong left, his pilot let out a reef and asked him to
run up to them. Pinturischio responded instantaneously and shot up to
them, only to be steadied again. The manner in which he accelerated
when given the <quote>office</quote> was that of a high-class horse, and
reminiscent of what we used to see St. Paddy do at this time last
year.
   <p>Whatever Pinturischio has been asked to do to date, he has
accomplished in effortless style, and his future is obviously
extremely bright. By and large it is usually as well to dismiss
home-trained colts that did not race at two years of age from one's
calculations on the Derby.
<head>Long Stride</head>
   <p>It stands to reason that if a horse is too backward to race
during his first season in training, he is most unlikely to be
sufficiently mature to beat the best of his generation in the late May
or early June of the following year, and it is a number of years now
since a horse that embarked upon its three-year-old career unraced has
won the Derby.
   <p>Captain Boyd-Rochfort's Prince Simon came within an ace of
doing so in 1950, and it is interesting to note that he made a winning
debut in the Wood Ditton Stakes.
   <p>The foregoing precedent need not prejudice our assessment of
Pinturischio's prospects unduly, as there are extenuating
circumstances in his case.
   <p>He did start to come to himself last back-end, and he impressed
on several occasions when his long stride enabled him to lay up in
seven furlong spins with more forward companions. Such was his
progress during those Autumn months that Noel Murless had intended to
give him an outing on the Rowley Mile course here, but unfortunately
the going came up heavy and the project was abandoned.
<head>Stern Opposition</head>
   <p>Although the Wood Ditton Stakes is confined to three-year-olds
that have never run at starting, the opposition is likely to be stern
enough to test Pinturischio.
   <p>Jack Jarvis's Allenby and Captain Boyd-Rochfort's Sagacity have
been working as though they will prove particularly formidable rivals
to him. Allenby is much more forward than Pinturischio and the other
morning he was not disgraced in a seven furlong gallop with Test Case,
Pinzon and Bold Liver.
   <p>Of course Allenby has no claims to being the peer of the
stable's Derby horse Test Case, but he fared well enough in the
latter's company to suggest that he will be a factor with which to be
reckoned in any maiden race.
   <p>The morning of the day in which Harry Carr met with his
accident at Lincoln, he rode Sagacity in a six furlong gallop with
Pardao (D. Smith), Good Old Days (T. Lowrey) and the four-year-old
Polo (W. Snaith) on the Racecourse Side. Carr held Sagacity a
couple of lengths behind the others from start to finish in this spin,
and considering that the trip was too sharp for such a big horse as
this handsome son of Le Sage he acquitted himself extremely well.
   <p>Sagacity could be the one to give Pinturischio most to do if they
meet next Thursday.
<head>An Omen</head>
   <p>Pinturischio has impressed so much by the way in which he has
done his work rather than what he has done in it, that I fully expect
him to lay a solid foundation to his claims to be considered the Derby
winner by scoring on the first occasion he faces the racecourse's acid
test.
   <p>There are flowers on the Poor Boy's grave, the resting place of
a shepherd boy, who committed suicide after losing his master's sheep
about 100 years ago, situated between the Limekilns and Waterhall, and
the superstitious say it is an omen that a Newmarket horse will win
the Derby.
   <p>If they are right, Pinturischio need not necessarily be the one
to oblige. In our enthusiasm over this dark 'un, we must not forget
about Test Case. He proved he was a good horse by winning three of
his four races last year.
   <p>Furthermore Pinturischio is not the only string to Murless's
powerful bow. Golden Voice, Hunter's Song, Aurelius and So Cozy are
all very nice colts with the scope to train on into fancied Derby
candidates. I suspect that Lester Piggott has a particularly soft
spot for Aurelius, as he has ridden the horse on each of the last
three galloping mornings, and each time has had a good ride.
<head>Great Promise</head>
   <p>The only time that Aurelius ran last year, he showed great
promise by running on well to take fourth place behind Beta, Dual and
Orbit in the Royal Lodge Stakes at the Ascot Heath meeting transferred
to Newbury.
   <p>As he has done so well in his recent work he is more than likely
to make a successful reappearance in the Craven Stakes, run over a
mile here next Tuesday.
   <p>Alternatively Murless's interests could be represented by
either Magnificat or So Cozy in that event, but as it is Aurelius's
only engagement of the week it seems likely that he will run.
   <p>Both Jack Langley's Prince Tudor and John Oxley's Eagle are
expected to wait for the Free Handicap on Wednesday, when Prince Tudor
will be ridden by his Guineas jockey Bill Rickaby.
   <p>Thus the most dangerous rivals to Aurelius could be Jack Jarvis's
Pinzon, and Dick Hern's Penhill.
   <p>Pinzon shone in a gallop over seven furlongs with Test Case last
week and Penhill must be respected by reason of his having finished
fast to run Morgan to half a length in the Coventry Stakes, at Kempton
Park on Monday.
   <p>Besides the Wood Ditton Stakes and the Craven Stakes, the Free
Handicap could also be an informative classic trial. Among those
holding the engagement in whom I am interested are Eagle, Prince
Tudor, Smuggler's Joy, and Pardao.
<head>Obvious Choice</head>
   <p>As Eagle won his gallop from the older Zanzibar last Saturday,
he would appear the obvious choice in this race, but neither
Smuggler's Joy or Pardao will be easy to beat.
   <p>Smuggler's Joy, like Pinzon, has been putting in some good work
upsides Test Case, while Pardao shaped well in the work with Sagacity
and Good Old Days referred to above. Since then Pardao has received
an indirect compliment by Good Old Days having run Dual to a neck in
the 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Kempton Park.
   <p>Plenty of rain has fallen here lately, so the going should be
perfect next week. By the end of it we should be in a far better
position to anticipate the outcome of both the 2,000 Guineas and the
Derby.
<head>Today's Nap</head>
   <p>Without Doug Smith having to bring pressure to bear, Crown
Imperial ran on well to finish third to the older horse Prince Chamier
and Final Problem in a seven-furlong trial on the Limekilns the Monday
before Easter. Since then the colt has been noted moving very
smoothly in all his work.
   <p>Reproduction of the trial form should enable Crown Imperial, who
is the nap, to win the Bardolph Plate (4-0).
   <p>Cingle, who is under orders for the Round Tower Handicap
(3-30), is expected to become Jack Langley's first winner since he
took charge of Mr. W. J. Weston-Evans' horses at Herringswell
Manor.
   <p>The four-year-old Cingle has been moving strongly on the regular
occasions that he has led work for the classic horse Prince Tudor.
   <p>Jack Jarvis made use of the Railway Land to give some of his
team good sharpening-up work over five and six furlongs.
   <p>Test Case (E. Larkin) was noted working well when accompanied
by Bold Lover over six furlongs. Sticky Case, Divine Comedy and Beta
were also sent over a similar distance.
   <p>Jaquetta and Saint Sybil had sharpening-up exercise.
   <p>Welsh Rake and Bass Rock covered five furlongs at a sharp pace,
and Sybil's Comb, Fringe, Kilifi and Lion's Mantle were similarly
employed.
   <p>G. Brooke also sharpened up some of his older horses over
five furlongs, these being Felix, with Menelek and Court Imperial.
   <p>Quota and Kathie were noted having a similar spin.
   <p>J. F. Watts, H. Thomson Janes and W. Hern also gave
their teams exercise on the Railway Land.
   <p>On the Racecourse side B. \van Cutsem's Seam (E. Smith)
was accompanied by Prince Bula in a nice-pace gallop over seven
furlongs. Other teams seen on these training grounds were those of
G. Barling, H. Cottrill, Reg Day and John Waugh, where work was
confined to cantering.
<head>Latest from Epsom</head>
<head>Nightingall May Have a Double</head>
   <p>WALTER NIGHTINGALL and his stable jockey Duncan Keith should
follow up yesterday's success of Release with a double at Windsor,
which may be initiated by Duke Toledo in the Round Tower Handicap
(3-30) and completed by King's Probity, who goes for the Hatch Bridge
Handicap (4-30).
   <p>Duke Toledo demonstrated that he is an early-season performer
by winning over today's distance, an extended mile at the
corresponding meeting last year, when he comfortably beat Indian Rock
and Martian, a winner at Hurst Park on Wednesday.
   <p>Following this victory, Walter Nightingall ran the colt at the
Epsom Spring Meeting where he was defeated by his burden of 9st.
3lb. and then he failed against some of the best milers in Royal
Ascot's Queen Anne Stakes. He had only one other outing, at Kempton
Park in soft going, which was probably the cause of his poor showing.
   <p>If Duke Toledo reproduces his form of 12 months ago he should
find little difficulty in accounting for today's opposition.
   <p>The three-year-old, King's Probity, was a most consistent
juvenile, never being out of the first four in six attempts. He lost
his maiden allowance at Brighton in September, when he easily beat
Dolaucothi and should be ready to do the trick here.
   <p>Mambo, from Peter Ashworth's Treadwell stables, could be the one
to give King's Probity most trouble, as he wound up a promising
two-year-old career with a win at Yarmouth, but Nightingall's charge
may just have the edge.
<head>Cost 6,500gns.</head>
   <p>Staff Ingham's horses, who usually register early successes,
seem to be more backward this year, but the stable can get off the
mark in the Cannon Yard Plate (3-0) with Red Imp, a 1,050 guineas
Magic Red colt, who is preferred to Jackie Sirett's Baba.
   <p>Another winner for Ingham may well be Mr. Bernard Sunley's
Raincourt, who was one of the highest priced yearlings of 1959,
costing 6,500 guineas.
   <p>The son of Court Martial has made only one public appearance in
which he showed considerable promise by putting in his best work
during the closing stages behind Blue Sash at Headquarters in
September. This experience should be enough to give Raincourt victory
in the Bardolph Plate (4-0).
   <p>Fridolanna, who finished fourth to Troilus at Lincoln, will find
the one and a half miles of the Upper Sixpenny Handicap (5-0) to
her liking and is fancied to beat Harold Wallington's Hanbury Lad.
<head>Prince Midge is Windsor Nap</head>
   <p>CLASSIC contender Prince Midge, making his only appearance
prior to the 2,000 Guineas, returns to the scene of his solitary
success in four ventures last term at Windsor, where he is napped to
win the Robert Wilmot Plate (5-0) today.
   <p>R. J. Colling has already made his mark with some of his
charges, and the Hurst Park winner Welsh Huntress, a galloping
companion of Prince Midge, gives a line to the well being of Mr.
J. Astor's colt who is reported one of the most forward of the team.

<head>THIS CRICKET RECORD IS TOO BAD</head>
<head>Pakistan are dreary</head>
   <p>While in Australia, cricket is fairly exploding into life,
and in England top players and administrators are loud with pious
hopes that the contagion of excitement may spread here, look at what
is happening to the first-class game in India.
   <p>In Amritsar, whose name in Sanskrit means <quote>pool of
immortality,</quote> Pakistan's cricketers have just taken a further step
toward deathless record-book fame in its dreariest form. They drew
the 13th match of their Indian tour, just as they had drawn all the
other 12.
   <p>There is significance for England in this dolorous record. Given
good weather, the coming summer &mdash; when the Australians are the
visitors &mdash; should be a fair one for the first-class game.
   <p>But 1962 may well be critical for by then the new look to be
given to the game by the MCC committee charged with that task
should begin to take shape.
   <p>And who comes here in 1962? Pakistan. These visitors from a hot
climate could deliver a most damaging cold douche on all our good
intentions and once more drive the crowds away. It is time that they
took note of what is happening elsewhere in the Commonwealth of
cricket.
<head>Still aglow</head>
   <p>Back to the comparative calm of his car-hire business in
Croydon today, but still glowing mentally, was MARTIN TURNER,
whose refereeing of the Barbarians v. Springboks game on Saturday
contributed largely to a great robust match which was never allowed to
get out of hand.
   <p>Turner (39) himself a former Barbarian, an Old Whitgiftian and
Cambridge Blue, was twice capped by England as a wing three-quarter in
his playing days. He has been refereeing for the six years since. He
was appointed to the County panel only this season.
   <p>Of Saturday's match, he told me: <quote>It was an awfully nice game
to handle. Too tough? Of course not. When you have 30 of the
world's best players on the field, it's got to be a hard game.
   <p><quote>Baa-Baas rose to the occasion and were given full credit by the
South Africans, who are very nice fellows. It was the second time I
had refereed them. I was in charge of their game against Combined
Services on Boxing Day.
   <p><quote>Of course, every player has an occasional swear at the
referee &mdash; I know I did when I played.</quote>
<head>Sales slump</head>
   <p>MRS. BARBARA HITCHCOCK, non-golfing wife of Master golfer
JIMMY HITCHCOCK, is finding business rather slack in her role of
deputy professional at the Ashford Manor, Middlesex, club.
   <p>While her husband is away in South Africa &mdash; he plays in the South
African open at East London on February 16-18 &mdash; she is looking after
the shop. And with the course closed by rain, she has run into a
sales slump.
   <p>She tells me her husband had thought of going to America to
compete in the U.S. Masters tournament. <quote>But it clashed with
the British season and he must be back to play his way into the Ryder
Cup team.</quote>
   <p>Hitchcock, who is 30, has an ambition outside the sport which I
find refreshing.
   <p><quote>I want to earn enough money from golf to enable my father to
stop working,</quote> he says.
   <p>It is the kind of ambition many sportsmen shelve when they meet
with success.
<head>Chelsea stand by</head>
   <p>If Huddersfield are knocked out in their FA Cup replay with
Barnsley this afternoon, they may be forced to part with their English
international left-back, RAMON WILSON. Chelsea are waiting on the
sidelines ready to make a bid.
   <p>This is no reflection on Chelsea's 17-year-old back ALAN
HARRIS.
   <p>TED DRAKE, Chelsea manager, says of them: <quote>They are both
great prospects. But Wilson has invaluable experience and he is the
enthusiastic type of player who would be a great help to our
youngsters.</quote>
   <p>Wilson earned a regular place in the England team last season,
but lost it to McNEIL, of Middlesbrough, this season because of
a cartilage injury. He is 26, and would welcome a move to First
Division football.
<head>Soccer art</head>
   <p>If England and Fulham captain JOHNNY HAYNES is anxious to
avoid any further half-time dressing room wrangles with his club
team-mates, he might well take a look at the FA Book for Boys.
   <p>It contains an article by Fulham's JIMMY HILL, who was
strongly critical of Haynes after their match against Chelsea, on the
art of captaining a soccer side.
   <p>But when I asked Hill today whether, in his capacity as chairman
of the Professional Footballers' Association, he was prepared to say
anything about captains who gesticulate, show their displeasure and
sometimes disgust when passes go astray, he refused.
   <p>But, surely, as the man who led the fight &mdash; and won &mdash; for higher
pay, Hill should be just as anxious to ensure <quote>officially</quote> that his
Association members conform to the highest code of behaviour &mdash;
captains included.
<head>Amateur golf championship to cost more this year</head>
<head>By JOHN INGHAM</head>
   <p>The amateur golf championship is to cost more &mdash; the entrance
fee shooting up from &pound;2 to &pound;4 4s. for the 1961 event, which begins
at Turnberry, Scotland, on June 12.
   <p>Another shock for golfers is that only 250 (with handicaps of
three or better) will be allowed to compete. This restricted entry
will be enforced by a ballot, to be held on May 12.
   <p>Qualifying rounds, played in recent years, have been abandoned,
making a limit clause essential.

   <p>If you won the amateur title, where would you put the trophy?
The Royal and Ancient insist: <quote>The trophy shall be held by the club
from which the winner entered.</quote> And not, apparently, on your
mantelpiece.

   <p>But if golfers are seeing trophies-before-the-eyes, I should
point out that Joe Carr will be defending his title.
<head>DOWNES FIGHTS RODRIGUEZ</head>
<head>By WALTER BARTLEMAN</head>
   <p>Terry Downes, Britain's middleweight champion, is to meet a
cruiser at Wembley on March 7 when he takes on the Californian
<quote>Kid</quote> Sixto Rodriguez over ten rounds at 12 stone.
   <p>The 23-year-old Rodriguez who is a former Californian
cruiserweight champion, began boxing as a professional in 1956 and has
a record that is liberally sprinkled with inside-the-distance
victories.
   <p>Downes has made a swift recovery from the nose injuries he
received in his unsuccessful world middleweight title fight with Paul
Pender in Boston last month.
   <p>Now, in meeting a cruiserweight, he will safeguard any further
world championship aspirations.
<head>Millwall plan cuts &mdash; and no manager</head>
<head>By HAROLD PALMER</head>
   <p>There is a new outlook at Millwall after Saturday's home defeat
by Oldham. Hope of promotion is practically abandoned. New plans are
being made &mdash; and they do not include a replacement for Reg Smith, the
manager they sacked three weeks ago.
   <p>The emphasis is likely to be on coaching, with general
administration resting in the hands of the present staff.
   <p>Chairman Micky Purser tells me he is preparing the new plan,
which he hopes to present to the board within the next two weeks.
   <p>Playing staff is to be reduced from 26 to about 18, because
whatever the Football Combination decide Millwall will not field
reserve teams on Saturdays next season.
<head>No long journeys</head>
   <p>Millwall will also refuse to take part in a reserve competition
even in mid-week if long journeys are involved.
   <p><quote>The competition must be regional to suit us,</quote> says Purser.
<quote>Otherwise we shall hope to get Queen's Park Rangers, Charlton,
Leyton Orient and Fulham to join us in a new reserve competition. We
would only need to have a dozen clubs to make the League
worthwhile.</quote>
   <p>ARSENAL look like losing Scottish international Jackie
Henderson for two or three weeks. He has a bad ankle injury.
   <p>I should think this will mean David Herd, out with flu on
Saturday, finding inside-left his position when he resumes.
   <p>LEYTON ORIENT take advantage of having a League fixture at
Liverpool on Saturday to put in a week's special training at
Southport &mdash; with the following week's Cup tie particularly in mind.
   <p>They took 13 players, Saturday's team plus Terry McDonald
(outside-left) and Malcolm Lucas (wing-half) North today.
   <p>John Richards returns to the ALDERSHOT team at inside-left
for tonight's second replay of the fourth round FA Cup tie with
Stoke at Wolverhampton (7.15).
<head>Richards is back</head>
   <p>Richards was missing from the Aldershot team on Saturday for
the first time since he joined them last October. With his return
Parnell moves back to the wing to the exclusion of Burton.
   <p>Both SOUTHAMPTON and BURNLEY will lack their star
inside-rights for tonight's quarter-final in the Football League Cup
at Southampton (7.0).
   <p>Irish international Jimmy McIlroy, who has recently had a broken
nose, flu and a cut knee, has been advised to rest. Southampton's
George O'Brien received a leg injury on Saturday and is replaced by
Clifton.

<head>JIMMY GREAVES HAS TWO AIMS</head>
<head>By BERNARD JOY</head>
   <p>Before leaving for Liverpool for training with the England team
tonight, Chelsea inside-forward Jimmy Greaves told me: <quote>Barcelona?
My immediate future lies with Chelsea and probably my long-term
future as well.</quote>
   <p>He then went off to telephone Chelsea to give the assurance to
manager Ted Drake.
   <p>Greaves told me: <quote>I am concerned with two things at the moment,
helping Chelsea to a respectable position in the table &mdash; and that is
the aim of every Chelsea player &mdash; and getting my own form back.
   <p><quote>I have no intention of asking for a transfer. It is highly
probable that I shall be staying with Chelsea for a good while or even
indefinitely.</quote>
   <p>Having knocked Real Madrid out of the European Cup, Barcelona are
determined to hold on to the prize of supremacy in Spain, and even
Europe.
<head>Nothing hasty</head>
   <p>Free-scoring Greaves &mdash; who will be 21 in a fortnight's time &mdash;
would fit into their attack and naturalisation is an easy matter for
imported foreign stars &mdash; like Di Stefano, Kubala and Martinez.
   <p>Italian clubs have also made approaches for Greaves, although
they are barred from obtaining new players from abroad until after the
1962 World Cup.
   <p>Greaves comments: <quote>I was told at Stamford Bridge on Saturday
that a Barcelona representative was at the match. I would be
interested, of course, but I wouldn't be so hasty as a couple of
months ago before the new set-up was introduced into English
football.</quote>
   <p>Greaves was restless two months ago and the rumour was current
that he wanted to leave Chelsea.
   <p>When I asked if his changed attitude meant that he was now happy,
he replied quickly: <quote>I'm not happy. I'm having a bad time and the
club are having a bad time. You can't be happy under those
conditions.
   <p><quote>But I have shelved all ideas of making a move from Chelsea.</quote>
<head>Three on short list</head>
   <p>The short list of three for the post of coach is Vic
Buckingham, the former West Bromwich manager and coach of Ajax, the
Dutch champions, Bobby Campbell, coach of Reading, and Tom Docherty,
the Arsenal and Scotland wing-half. Roy Bentley, the Fulham and
former Chelsea player, is not in the list because Chelsea are looking
for a man with FA coaching qualifications.
   <p>Buckingham, 45, steered West Bromwich in nearly carrying off the
Cup and League double in 1953-4. A former Spurs defender, he left
West Bromwich two seasons ago.
   <p>A big point in his favour is that he struck up a personal
friendship with Ted Drake when they were stationed together in the
RAF.
   <p>Campbell, a Scottish international winger, played for Chelsea for
six seasons before going to Reading in 1954.
<head>Dave Dick is fined for 'chase error: Ragd falls</head>
<head>From PETER SCOTT: Fontwell Park, Monday</head>
   <p>Crack Epsom jockey Dave Dick was right out of luck here at
Fontwell Park this afternoon. He had two fancied mounts for Bryan
Marshall's Lambourn stable but Bold Ruler, the first of them, cost him
a &pound;15 fine from the Stewards. The second, Ragd, tumbled at the first
fence in the Horsham Handicap 'Chase.
   <p>Dick's fine was for carelessness in mistaking a plain fence in
Division 1 of the Findon Novices 'Chase for the water jump which
followed it. The water obstacle had been excluded because of the very
heavy going.
   <p>Bold Ruler was in the lead when Dick made his mistake four fences
from home.

<head>Excavation Work Identifies Shrine Chapel</head>
<head>WALSINGHAM EVIDENCE</head>
   <p>EXCAVATION of the small building on the north side of the
ruined Priory church at Walsingham has shown this to be the remains of
the Chapel of the Shrine of Our Lady, visited and described by William
of Worcester in 1479.
   <p>The shrine, a small wooden building, was founded, according to
tradition, in A.D. 1061 &mdash; though historians have in general
placed it a little later &mdash; and a generation later the Priory was
established to guard the shrine.
   <p>At a later date, the stone chapel was built to cover and protect
the original shrine and this building, the <quote>Novum Opus</quote> of
William, is first recorded in his description. It was also seen by
Erasmus in 1511.
   <p>For more than a century, since the first test excavation by Canon
James Lee Warner, there has been some controversy, both on the nature
of his findings and on the date of the various buildings. These new
excavations, directed by the archaeological consultant to the Ministry
of Works, Mr. Charles Green, on behalf of the Walsingham Excavation
Committee, were designed to resolve these difficulties.
<head>Remodelled</head>
   <p>The existing remains of the Priory church have long made it
clear that extensive building took place in the 14th century, when the
original Norman church was replaced by a great aisled church with a
central tower. This was again modified early in the 15th century when
the east window was remodelled in the Perpendicular style.
   <p>Embedded in the north wall of this church were found remains of
the original Norman church and some direct evidence of the central
tower which before had been known only from the medieval description.
   <p>The excavations also showed that, shortly after the church itself
was rebuilt, the Chapel of the Shrine was erected. Further
confirmation of its purpose was seen in its layout. It lay at an
angle to the church, showing that its contents were of more importance
even than the church. Its massive walls, too, gave evidence of its
precious contents.
<head>Post-Holes</head>
   <p>Of the original wooden shrine there was little direct evidence.
After the building of the chapel, it is known to have stood above the
chapel floor. As this floor had been almost completely destroyed, no
remains of the shrine could be detected.
   <p>Furthermore, the levelling of the sloping site by the chapel
builders had destroyed much of the original surface. But indications
of a few post-holes and supports which belonged to a period before the
chapel, in use until the chapel was built, gave evidence of a
contained wooden building, though their remnants were not sufficient
to determine its exact size and plan.
   <p>This levelling had another, unexpected, result. It had brought
close to the surface an Anglo-Saxon cemetery of much earlier date and
these graves were seen to have been cut through and destroyed by the
chapel builders.
<head>Pagan Site?</head>
   <p>With them occurred a series of post-holes of similar date,
forming a pattern not closely related to the later buildings. The
date and nature of these suggest the possibility of an early pagan
Saxon shrine on this site. It is well known that early Christian
priests often built their new churches on pagan sites, thus hallowing
the temple sites of the heathen deities.
   <p>A strong <quote>treasure house</quote> or sacristy had later been added to
the east end of the chapel. A great porch at the west end, of still
later date, was probably being built in 1511 when Erasmus described
the chapel as <quote>unfinished.</quote>
   <p>In the centre of the chapel was a great stone-built tomb,
probably that of Sir Bartholomew Burghersh, who died in 1369, and a
smaller stone coffin was perhaps of the last canon in charge before
the Dissolution in 1539.
<head>Second Pilot Vessel Launched at Lowestoft</head>
   <p>THE PILOT VESSEL Preceder, second of two sister ships which
Brooke Marine are building for Trinity House, was launched at
Lowestoft yesterday by Mrs. Galpin, wife of Capt. R. J.
Galpin, an Elder Brother of the Corporation.
   <p>Among the launching party were Field-Marshal Sir Claude
Auchinleck, chairman of Dowsett Holdings, the parent company of Brooke
Marine, Mr. H. L. Dowsett, chairman of Brooke Marine, and
Capt. D. Mansfield, superintendent pilot at Harwich.
   <p>Before being launched the ship was blessed by the Rector of
Lowestoft (the Rev. W. J. Westwood).
   <p>The Preceder, sister ship to Patrol, which was launched in June,
is 39 feet long with a beam of 24 feet and a draught of ten feet five
inches. She is powered by two six-cylinder Lister engines which
develop 495 b.h.p. driving a single screw, and she has a designed
speed of just under 13 knots.
   <p>She will be equipped with radar and echo sounder, a combined
A.M.S.M.&sol; VHF set, and medium frequency radio telephone.
Accommodation will be provided for a crew of 20 with Pullman-type
bunks for 12 pilots, and she will carry two boarding boats and
inflatable life rafts.
   <p>When completed in December she will take up duties as a tender
between Harwich and the pilot cutter on station at the Sunk, where she
will speed up the service considerably, as she is to replace a
nine-knot ship.
<head>Nine Per Cent. Drop in Farm Incomes</head>
   <p>FARM INCOMES in England and Wales in 1959 fell by nearly
nine per cent. on the previous year, according to a booklet
published yesterday by the National Farmers' Union.
   <p>Figures given in the booklet, based on the union's farm accounts
scheme, show that except for cereal growers, the long dry summer of
1959 was not generally favourable to farmers. In particular, the
shortage of grazing caused by drought necessitated heavy purchases of
feeding stuffs.
   <p>Record cereal crops largely account for an increase of nearly
nine per cent. in the earnings of the specialist arable farms, which
the previous year fell by about 10 per cent.
<head>Dairy Farms</head>
   <p>According to the booklet, the livestock sector fared worse than
any other in 1959, as it had in 1958.
   <p>A fall of 17 per cent. that year was followed by a reduction of
18 per cent. in 1959. On mixed livestock farms, incomes fell by
over 11 per cent.
   <p>On dairy farms and mixed dairy farms, profits fell by more than
10 per cent. A slight increase in revenue was <quote>substantially
outweighed</quote> by heavy increases in feeding stuff expenditure.
   <p>The booklet also says that the substantial increase in egg output
in 1959 led to a reduction in price, and as a result of a decline in
income, and an increase in expenditure, the profits of specialist egg
producers fell by over 58 per cent. Profits on mixed farms where
egg production was the largest single enterprise fell by over seven
per cent.
   <p>The results, says the booklet, are based on sample accounts of
3709 farms whose year-ending date fell between June 1st, 1959, and May
31st, 1960.
<head>West Raynham Airman Sent for Trial</head>
   <p>PATRICK JOSEPH MALONEY (27), of 36, Airmen's Married
Quarters, R.A.F. West Raynham, was committed to Quarter Sessions
at Fakenham Court yesterday on a charge of breaking and entering a
lock-up coffee bar in Bridge Street, Fakenham, between August 10th and
11th and stealing a quantity of sweets, chocolates, and money, to a
total value of &pound;4 18s. 8 1/2d.
   <p>Mr. Brian John Bedford, a service engineer, of 28, Grange Road,
Bushey, Hertfordshire, said he was acting manager of the coffee bar.
   <p>When he went to it one morning, the first thing he noticed was
that the shelf on which chocolates and sweets were placed, was bare.
He found that the rear door of the premises had been forced.
<head>Green Fibres</head>
   <p>P.C. A. D. Willsher said that he examined the coffee
bar and found several green fibres in a door post and also on two
crates of soft drinks. Later Maloney produced the clothing he had
been wearing the previous day and this included a green wool sweater.
   <p>Maloney was cautioned and he said, <quote>If you come round to my
house at 4.30 I will give you the stuff.</quote> He later produced the
sweets and chocolates in a cardboard box from his car and then went
into the house and gave them two piggy banks which contained 18s. 7
1/2d. in cash saying, <quote>That is the money I took.</quote>
   <p>In a statement to P.C. Willsher, Maloney said, <quote>I had a
row with my wife. I lost my head and went on the booze. I would not
have done it if I had not had so much to drink.</quote> He was sorry for
the inconvenience he had caused the coffee bar manager.
   <p>In court Maloney said he would like to confirm what he had said
in his statement and would like to add that he was thoroughly ashamed
of the whole business.
   <p>He was granted bail.
<head>Felmingham Funeral of Mrs. E. T. Lawrence</head>
   <p>The funeral of Mrs. Lucy May Lawrence, wife of Mr. Ernest
Thomas Lawrence, of 1, Heath View, Felmingham, took place at St.
Andrew's Church, Felmingham. The Assistant Curate of North Walsham,
the Rev. Michael Pavey, officiated, assisted by the superintendent
minister of the North Walsham Methodist Circuit, the Rev. Charles
Staden.
   <p>Born at Worstead 77 years ago, Mrs. Lawrence was a land worker
throughout the first world war and received a diploma from the
Minister of Agriculture. For 17 years she was a National Savings
collector in the parish.
   <p>Mrs. Lawrence leaves her husband, two sons and two daughters.

<head>THEFT BY ROLLS ROYCE VAN MAN</head>
   <p>A police constable was cycling on his beat at Foulsham when he
saw a young man removing piping from huts on the derelict airfield,
near the village, Reepham magistrates were told yesterday.
   <p>Anthony Bower (21), a carpenter, of Rake's Progress, Guestwick,
pleaded guilty to stealing asbestos guttering, pipe and outlets valued
at &pound;2 9s. 2d., belonging to the Air Ministry.
   <p>He was fined &pound;5 after admitting that he used a Rolls-Royce van
without insurance.
   <p>Inspector John Kenny, prosecuting, said that P.C. James Dent
saw Bower removing the guttering. Nearby stood Bower's Rolls-Royce
van with some guttering inside.
<head>Derelict Cottage</head>
   <p>In a statement to the police Bower was alleged to have said
that he had got possession of a derelict cottage in Guestwick rent
free and intended to use the guttering for repairs. The inspector
said defendant  had been very helpful to the police.
   <p>When the chairman, the Hon. Mrs. Barclay, asked Bower if he
would accept probation, Bower asked what was the alternative. He was
told it might be a fine.
   <p>Bower: How much would the fine be? &mdash; Mrs. Barclay: We don't
know.
   <p>Bower: All right. I will accept probation.
   <p>He was put on probation for 12 months.
<head>VERY UNSATISFACTORY MARRIAGE, COURT TOLD</head>
   <p>HOW PEOPLE thought they could build a happy married life
when their sole object, whenever they had enough money, was to
separate and spend the evening in different public-houses was
difficult to imagine, said Judge Carey Evans, sitting as Commissioner
for Divorce, at Norwich Divorce Court yesterday.
   <p>He granted a decree nisi to Mr. Arthur George Boyce, of 29,
Green Lane Estate, Fakenham, on the grounds of his wife's desertion
and her adultery with an unknown man. He exercised his discretion in
favour of the husband's admitted adultery.
   <p>The wife, Mrs. Nancy Audrey Boyce, of 9, Green Lane Estate,
Fakenham, denied her husband's allegations and alleged cruelty,
desertion and adultery on his part.

<head>COURT QUIZ ON IDENTITY METHODS</head>
   <p>Police methods of holding identity parades were questioned in a
Darlington court today by Mr. Colin Black, defending solicitor for
28-year-old unemployed labourer, James Rudd Fenwick of Estoril Road,
Darlington.
   <p>Det.-Con. Henry Hammond gave evidence that he and Mr. James
Hughes, another witness in the case, had been standing in Northgate on
Sunday, October 8. Mr. Hughes had recognised a man who had asked
D.C. Hammond for a light.
<head>Cross-examination</head>
   <p>Cross-examining, Mr. Black asked: <quote>Did you suggest to Mr.
Hughes that this could be the man?</quote> &mdash; <quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why were you in Northgate?</quote> &mdash; <quote>We were there with a view to
identifying the defendant. I had asked Mr. Hughes to come along.</quote>
   <p><quote>Ah, is this the way to carry out an identity parade?</quote> Mr.
Stanley Walton, prosecuting, stood up. <quote>I object. It was not an
identity parade.</quote>
<head>Question reframed</head>
   <p>Mr. Black: <quote>I'll reframe the question. You have been
trained in methods of identity parade. Is this the correct way?</quote> &mdash;
<quote>There is no strict way.</quote>
   <p><quote>You refuse to give a straight answer?</quote> &mdash; <quote>No, sir. I
answered your question.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Walton rose again: <quote>He has said there is no strict
way.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Black: <quote>Let me reframe again. Is there any recommended
method?</quote> &mdash; <quote>Yes, when applicable.</quote>
   <p><quote>This wasn't such a case?</quote> &mdash; <quote>No.</quote>
   <p><quote>Why were you particularly in Northgate?</quote> &mdash; <quote>I knew the
defendant was coming along. Some member of the force had asked him to
come to the police station.</quote>
   <p><quote>Had Hughes been shown photographs of the defendant?</quote> &mdash;
<quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p><quote>And other men?</quote> &mdash; <quote>Yes.</quote>
<head>Sent for trial</head>
   <p>Fenwick was sent for trial to the next Durham Quarter Sessions
on charges of taking a car without the owner's consent, stealing a car
radio and driving while disqualified. Bail was allowed and a defence
certificate granted. Through Mr. Black, Fenwick denied all three
charges and reserved his defence.
   <p>When he elected to go for trial on a third count, a fourth case
of driving while uninsured was adjourned sine die.
   <p>When Fenwick arrived at the court &mdash; 20 minutes late &mdash; Mr. Black
apologised for him. <quote>He has two children and his wife is expecting
another,</quote> he said. <quote>He has had to arrange for his mother-in-law to
come in before he could come out.</quote> Fenwick was on his way to court
when police were sent to look for him.
<head>Parked car</head>
   <p>Darlington company director Mr. Brian Neasham said he had
parked the company's car on waste ground next to their Bowes Street
premises. This was on October 4. When he returned an hour later the
car was gone. It was returned to him by Middlesbrough police the next
day. <quote>It wasn't damaged in any way, but the radio was missing.</quote>
   <p>Outlining the case, Mr. Walton said: <quote>In fairness to the
defendant he wasn't with the car when it was found abandoned.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Hughes, a garagehand at Neasham's said he was sweeping the
yard when a man he recognised as the defendant came to the gate. He
said he was wanting a van or something, and Mr. Hughes said he would
have to see Mr. Burley, the commercial manager. The defendant said
he was waiting for his brother, waited some time and then went. Later
he returned.
   <p>When he returned, said Mr. Hughes, <quote>I pointed Mr. Burley out
to him.</quote> Later Mr. Hughes saw that the car had gone.
   <p>Cross examined by Mr. Black, Mr. Hughes agreed that he had
never seen the man before, and had only seen him once since. He was
certain that the defendant was the same man. <quote>He was wearing a light
fawn coloured mac and a greyish flat cap,</quote> said Mr. Hughes. But
he agreed: <quote>I wasn't taking much notice of the man. I wasn't
suspicious or anything.</quote> When he saw Fenwick on the Sunday he was
wearing <quote>a suit of a khaki drill colour.</quote>
<head>Heard car</head>
   <p>Mr. Kenneth Burley could not give a positive identification
of anyone in court. But he had seen a man at the gate.
   <p>Said Mr. Burley: <quote>He was supposed to be waiting for his
brother and interested in a van.</quote>
   <p>Objected Mr. Black: <quote>Surely that's hearsay?</quote>
   <p>Retorted Mr. Walton: <quote>If you don't want it, we'll miss it
out.</quote>
   <p>Mr. Burley said he heard the engine of Mr. Neasham's car
start up and stall twice. He realised that it was not one of their
drivers or Mr. Neasham in the car, and ran towards it. It moved off
across the waste ground towards Brunswick Street.
   <p><quote>I ran after the car as it turned into Brunswick Street. The
driver looked back and I could see it was the same man who had stood
at the gate. He was wearing a light coloured raincoat and a cloth
cap.</quote>
<head>At Middlesbrough</head>
   <p>Middlesbrough welder Mr. Alan Breckon, of Snowdon Street told
the court he was in Middlesbrough on the corner of Sussex Street and
Richmond Street on the night of October 4. A man came out of a cafe
and asked him the way to Darlington, and then to Stockton. He
recognised the man as the defendant.
   <p>The man got into a car about 15 yards away and drove off. It was
a green Ford Consul, he said. Cross examined he said: <quote>It was an
ordinary green Ford Consul with a hard top &mdash; like an ordinary saloon.
It was definitely not a convertible.</quote>
   <p>He was sure it was a Consul and not a Zephyr. The man was
wearing <quote>a greyish coloured jacket, no raincoat.</quote> There was a
street lamp on the other side of the road about 24 feet away.
<head>On duty</head>
   <p>Re-examined by Mr. Walton he said he could not tell the
difference between a Consul and a Zephyr and this car <quote>was going away
fast.</quote>
   <p>Middlesbrough policeman Colin Redman said he was on duty in
Gosford Street walking towards Sussex Street when he saw a green Ford
Zephyr parked outside a cafe. <quote>Before I came on duty I had received
information that made me interested in this car.</quote>
   <p>When it drove towards him with headlights full on, he put up his
hand and flashed his torch. The driver ignored the signal and he had
to jump out of the way. He recognised the defendant as the driver.
He was wearing <quote>a corduroy flat cap, sports jacket and dark
trousers.</quote>
   <p>Cross examined he said he was about 20 yards from the man when he
got into the car. It was definitely a convertible. The street
lighting was sulphur lights on standards about 30 feet high.
<head>At Northgate</head>
   <p>He agreed with Mr. Black that sulphur lighting sometimes cast
a peculiar colour on people's faces, but <quote>the cafe strip lighting was
also on and the car was outside.</quote> The nearest light was <quote>about six
feet in front of the car.</quote> Was he sure of that, asked Mr. Black.
<quote>I'm fairly sure of my answer.</quote>
   <p><quote>So the last witness must be wrong if he says 24 feet?</quote> went
on Mr. Black. &mdash; <quote>Yes.</quote>
   <p>D. C. Hammond said the defendant had asked him for a light
in Northgate on the Sunday. He had been with Mr. Hughes in
Northgate. The defendant had been wearing <quote>a green checked suit.</quote>
<head>Reserved defence</head>
   <p>When charged at the police office with taking without consent,
Fenwick said: <quote>I've never been anywhere near the place (Neasham)</quote>.
He said he was in Middlesbrough on the Wednesday and came back by
taxi about midnight. <quote>I had a girl to meet, but I went on the bus
about six o'clock. I didn't take any car.</quote>
   <p>Charged with the other offences later he made no reply.
   <p>Durham policeman John Middlemiss said Fenwick had been convicted
of taking without consent, driving while disqualified, using an
uninsured vehicle, and using obscene language at a Durham court in
1956. He had then been banned from driving for ten years.
   <p>When the charges were read to him in court, through Mr. Black,
Fenwick said: <quote>I plead <squote>Not Guilty</squote> and reserve my defence.</quote>
<head>LADY CHAYTOR FINED &pound;50 AND BANNED</head>
   <p>Lady Patricia Chaytor &mdash; well-known as a horse lover &mdash; was fined
&pound;50 and banned from driving for six months at Bishop Auckland today
following a collision involving two National Hunt jockeys.
   <p>The wife of Sir William Chaytor, she lives in the 50-roomed
Witton Castle in the picturesque village of Witton-le-Wear.
<head>DENIED CHARGE</head>
   <p>On the advice of her solicitor Lady Chaytor, who denied a
charge of dangerous driving, did not go into the witness box.
   <p>Jerry Scott (last year's winner of the Grand National) and his
jockey friend Pat McCarron, gave evidence for the prosecution.
   <p><quote>These two men almost ended up in the West Auckland Cemetery &mdash;
in more senses than one,</quote> said Mr. H. Hewitt, prosecuting.
   <p>While driving towards Darlington through West Auckland they saw
another car approaching &mdash; on their side of the road.
<head>QUICK THINKING</head>
   <p><quote>Only the quick thinking of Pat saved a head-on collision,</quote>
Scott told the court. He said that as the other car drew near
McCarron swung their car sharply to the other side of the road. <quote>But
there was still a slight collision and the other car drove on. I
could not repeat what I said then!</quote>
   <p>The two jockeys in Scott's car turned around using the open gates
of the cemetery and chased after the other car. They finally caught
up with it at West Auckland.
   <p><quote>I kept my eye on it from the moment it smashed into us,</quote>
Scott said.
   <p><quote>When I got out of my car &mdash; if you will excuse the expression &mdash;
I said to the woman driver, <squote>What the hell are you doing?</squote> But
she did not reply.</quote>
<head>SLIGHT DAMAGE</head>
   <p>PC John Peacock said that when he arrived he found some
slight damage on the nearside of Lady Chaytor's car. She refused to
make a statement, he said, and told him: <quote>I have never had an
accident before, and I was never on the wrong side of the road.</quote>
When told about proceedings being taken she was alleged to have said,
<quote>You can do what you like.</quote>
   <p>For Lady Chaytor, Mr. N. Foster, of Darlington, said that she
did not think that bringing his client into the witness-box would be
of any assistance <quote>Because she cannot recollect this incident.</quote>
   <p>He said she had been driving for 25 years and had no previous
convictions.
<head>RECEIVED DRUGS</head>
   <p><quote>She stoutly denies this charge and she has not the slightest
recollection of this accident.</quote>
   <p>Two days before this, he said, Lady Chaytor had been in hospital
for observation and during that time had received drugs, some of which
contained an element of pheno-barbitone.
   <p><quote>The only conclusion she can come to regarding this accident is
that when it happened she was suffering from drowsiness as a result of
the drugs which had been given to her.</quote>
<head>YOUTHS STOLE PETROL FROM PARKED CAR</head>
   <p>A &pound;200 motor-cycle bought to keep a 16-year-old youth out of
trouble landed him in a court before the first hire-purchase payment
was due.
   <p>Speaking on behalf of her son before a Darlington court today a
working mother said that <quote>his heart had been so set on a
motor-bike</quote> that she had paid a &pound;50 deposit so that he could have
one for his birthday.
   <p>She added that she had not yet begun to pay the balance at the
rate of &pound;2 10s a week.
<head>SAID HE WOULD HELP</head>
   <p>Asked by the chairman of the Bench, Mr. J. Hemingway, how
much her son paid for his keep out of the &pound;3 18s he had just begun
to earn, she replied: <quote>I let him keep it for himself; he has had to
pay for tax and insurance but said he would help out with the
payments.</quote>
   <p>The youth appeared with another motor-cyclist, Henry Ernest
Chapman (19), of Railway Cottages, Hurworth Place, on a joint charge
of stealing petrol. They pleaded guilty.
   <p>Prosecuting, Chief-Insp. James Richardson said that two
policemen found Chapman and the youth hiding in a yard off
Skinner-gate on the evening of October 30.
   <p>Asked what they were doing they said they were looking for a
motor-cycle, but when further questioned, Chapman said: <quote>O.K.
They've found us out.</quote>

<text id=LOBA36>
<head>WARWICK RACECOURSE IS STILL IN THE RED</head>
   <p>WARWICK Racecourse is still in the red and is still showing a
loss, said Racecourse Committee chairman Alderman Guy Nelson at the
July meeting of Warwick Town Council. Because of that, the committee
had refused to increase prize money when asked to do so by the Jockey
Club.
   <p>Alderman Nelson was replying to two questions from members of the
council, who asked why the committee had not carried out the Jockey
Club's request. Councillor Fred Vittle said he thought that owners
and trainers would stop running their horses at Warwick if the prize
money was not increased.
<head>POSTPONED</head>
   <p>Councillor Fred Walters asked why the committee had refused the
increase before it found out about other racecourses. <quote>Is our prize
money as high as theirs?</quote> he asked.
   <p>Alderman Nelson said the committee had only said that the
increase should be postponed until a decision on betting levy
contributions to racecourse executives had been received.
   <p><quote>We shall still get plenty of horses. The horses that come to
Warwick do not come for the prize money, but for the public to bet
on,</quote> he added.
<head>Extensions at Chesford Grange will cost &pound;50,000</head>
   <p>BETTER known to Birmingham, Coventry and Leamington
connoisseurs for the excellence of its food and wines, but known by
guests from all parts of the country, Chesford Grange Hotel will soon
have an additional 21 luxurious modern bedrooms and a conference hall
seating 200 delegates or 120 diners.
   <p>The new bedrooms, each of which will have its own private bath or
shower, are all on the first floor, over the new conference hall,
which has its own entrance, bar, cloakrooms, and a laid dance-floor.
The new hall, to be called the Lilac Room, can be used either
separately or in conjunction with the main hall, and is a very
valuable extension of the already comprehensive conference facilities.
<head>CLEAN AND MODERN</head>
   <p>The new structure, which links the hotel to the ballroom, has a
white rendered finish to the ground floor and timber facings to the
first floor. The conference hall entrance is faced with green slate,
and the architectural treatment of the new building is clean and
modern, but still blends with the existing traditional architecture of
the older buildings it links.
   <p>The work, which includes complete modernisation of the entire
drainage system, will cost about &pound;50,000 and will be completed by
Christmas of this year. Main contractors are Turriff Construction
(Warwick) Ltd., the well-known Warwick and London builders.
<head>Unemployment decrease</head>
   <p><quote>The number of unemployed has fallen during the past three
months,</quote> said Miss N. L. Munton, manager of the Leamington and
Warwick Employment Exchange, at a meeting of the Leamington and South
Warwickshire Local Employment Committee held under the chairmanship of
Miss L. I. Bell, J.P.
   <p>The percentage for the area covered by this committee
(Leamington, Warwick, Stratford and Southam) is just under .5 compared
with .8 for the Midland Region and 1.2 for the country as a whole.
   <p>There are varied vacancies for both men and women, for the latter
especially in shops, cafes, hotels and domestic work, as well as
nursing and electrical work.
<head>Council questions on Warwick's overdraft</head>
   <p>IF Warwick Town Council's bank overdraft stopped, would all
the capital works undertaken by the council come to an end? asked
Councillor Fred Walters at the July meeting of the council. And, if
that happened, would council house rents be affected?
   <p>Councillor Walters was speaking on a Finance Committee
recommendation that the council should increase its overdraft to
&pound;250,000. The proposal was approved.
   <p>He said he had been surprised that the chairman of the committee
had not made a statement to the council, and added that he did not
think it necessary to have such a large overdraft for a town of
Warwick's size.
<head>WAS IT WISE?</head>
   <p>Before the chairman of the Finance Committee had chance
 to reply, Councillor Fred Vittle asked if it was wise to
increase the overdraft during the national economic crisis.
   <p>Councillor E. Lloyd-Averns Finance Committee chairman, said the
overdraft was not a large one, as many towns smaller than Warwick had
greater overdraft facilities.
   <p><quote>Its main purpose is to act as a buffer,</quote> he said.
   <p><quote>In so far as council house rents are concerned, they are run on
a completely different basis and cannot possibly be affected.</quote>
<head>Warwick and scheme for joint crematorium</head>
   <p>At a special meeting, Warwick General Purposes Committee
instructed the Crematorium Sub-Committee to oppose the proposals to
build a crematorium near the junction of the Banbury and Heathcote
roads. The sub-committee will press for the crematorium to be built
on the original site &mdash; by Leamington's Brunswick Street cemetery.
   <p>Warwick Town Council originally decided to build its own
crematorium, but in April last year it abandoned the idea and entered
into a joint scheme with Leamington Town Council and Warwick Rural
District Council. After representatives of the councils had met it
was decided to build the crematorium near Leamington cemetery.
<head>&pound;10,000 EXTRA</head>
   <p>After representatives of the firm of architects which built the
Medway Crematorium at Chatham had inspected five possible sites,
within Warwick and Leamington and Warwick rural district, they
recommended the site on rising ground at the junction of the Banbury
and Heathcote roads. The size of the site is 15 acres.
   <p>The chairman of Warwick Estates Committee, Alderman H. J.
Ansell, outlined the history of the proposed crematorium at the
special meeting of the General Purposes Committee. He said his
committee decided against the Heathcote Road site because of the extra
cost &mdash; about &pound;10,000.
<head>PIECEMEAL</head>
   <p>Chairman of the new Planning and Development Committee,
Councillor H. R. C. Walden, said it would be piecemeal
development for the Heathcote area. He said that would be one of the
few areas that Warwick could develop if the Green Belt inquiry proved
successful and it was wrong to spoil it by building the crematorium.
   <p>Councillor Leo Howlett said the eventual cost was likely to be
about &pound;125,000, of which Warwick would have to pay one fifth. <quote>If
we have got &pound;25,000 to spend let's spend it on the living,</quote> he
said.
<head>Maiden speech</head>
   <p>Councillor Donald Round made his first speech at a council
meeting when he asked the chairman of the Housing Committee what was
being done about the pavements and street lighting at Spinney Hill,
Warwick.
   <p>Councillor W. L. Tarver, the chairman of the Housing
Committee, said that the pavements and street lighting should be
installed within the next few months.
<head>A SILVER <quote>THANK YOU</quote></head>
   <p>To mark his services to the league &mdash; and also his silver
wedding &mdash; Mr. Walter Leslie, secretary of Warwick Hospital League of
Friends, has been presented with a pair of silver candlesticks.
   <p>The presentation took place in the hospital's new recreation
hall &mdash; which Mr. Leslie helped to get.
<head>Warwick Mayor to campaign for by-pass</head>
   <p>ALTHOUGH proposed more than 25 years ago, it would be at
least four years before anything was done about the Warwick by-pass,
said the Mayor of Warwick (Alderman James McGrouther) at a special
meeting of Warwick General Purposes Committee. He told the committee
that he was going to write to the Minister of Transport asking if he
would receive a deputation from the council.
   <p>To strengthen his case, said the Mayor, he would approach
transport federations and commission films of local traffic
congestion. He asked the Press for support and said he would take all
press cuttings he could find relating to the traffic conditions in the
town.
   <p>Councillor Fred Walters, leader of the Socialist group, said the
council had tried to do several small things in an effort to alleviate
the traffic congestion. <quote>Each time they have been refused by people
who have never been to Warwick,</quote> he added.
<head>Council's action on smokeless zones</head>
<head>Alderman says: <quote>We have got to be realists</quote></head>
   <p>IN A FRANK speech to the delegates at the annual meeting of
the Warwickshire Clean Air Council at Leamington, Alderman E. H.
Fryer told them the reasons why Leamington Town Council had postponed
its smokeless zones programme. But he promised that Leamington would
not hang back when there were sufficient supplies of smokeless fuels
available.
   <p>Welcoming the delegates on behalf of the Mayor (Councillor Miss
Christine Ledger), who was attending the Royal garden party at
Buckingham Palace, Alderman Fryer said he had been against smoke
control for Leamington right from the word go.
<head>MUST BE REALISTS</head>
   <p><quote>Criticism was levelled at us for going back on what we had
started to do, but we have got to be realists. If you are going to
change the Englishman's way of life you cannot do it in a hurry,</quote> he
said.
   <p><quote>It must be done very gradually indeed. In other words, one
must make haste slowly.
   <p><quote>The zones that were revoked covered a large area in which a lot
of old people lived. It was on their behalf, mainly, that the
programme was revoked.
<QUOTE/>
<head>TEMPERAMENTAL</head>
   <p><quote>You yourselves said there were insufficient supplies of
smokeless fuel and so coke must be used. Coke is temperamental; it
can make a good fire, or it can be a most depressing sight.
   <p><quote>Unless we can give people a similar fuel to coal, at a similar
price, then we are up against the wall. These are the reasons why the
smoke control zones in Leamington were rejected.
   <p><quote>When smokeless fuel is produced in abundance, and when it is a
reasonable price, I can assure you that Leamington Spa will not hang
back,</quote> added Alderman Fryer.
<head>DOCTOR'S LETTER</head>
   <p>At the quarterly meeting of the council, held at Sutton
Coldfield, the vice-chairman of the council, Councillor Robert
Loosley, of Coventry, claimed that Councillor Dr. H. Gibbons Ward,
of Leamington, had started the campaign against the smoke control
zones in Leamington by writing to the local Press. He asked the
council to deplore the doctor's action.
   <p>At the annual meeting, Dr. Gibbons Ward said unfortunately he
had not been at the Sutton Coldfield meeting and he wished to <quote>put
two or three things right.</quote>
<head><quote>MY PRIVILEGE</quote></head>
   <p><quote>I did not start the campaign by writing to the local Press.
I do not think it is the wish of this council that any member shall
not at any time disagree with decisions of the council.
   <p><quote>I should have thought that one would have been able to express
an opinion without being rebuked. It is my privilege to differ from
the council at any time,</quote> he added.
   <p>Later, Councillor Loosley said: <quote>I feel it is wrong for the
people of this council to get up at another meeting and decry our
efforts. It is the duty of a member of this council to support these
decisions outside the council. If not, at least they can keep
quiet.</quote>
<head>RADFORD SEMELE RAISES &pound;1,000</head>
   <p>ALTHOUGH formed only 18 months ago, Radford Semele Playing
Field Committee has raised &pound;1,000 towards amenities for the village
play  field.
   <p>After buying playground equipment, the committee still has a
credit balance of &pound;736, it was reported at the July meeting.
   <p>The committee agreed that it would push ahead as fast as possible
with fund raising schemes to make the playing field one of the finest
in Warwickshire.
   <p>Committee chairman Mr. P. Bramhall called for full village
support in the venture.
<head>Allotment land should be a playground, council told</head>
   <p>LAND originally set aside for allotments on the Percy
Estate, Warwick, would be very suitable for a children's playground,
said Councillor Mrs. E. A. Brown at the July meeting of Warwick
Town Council.
   <p><quote>Land behind the garages of Mill Road and Pattens Road was
originally allocated for allotments, but as the land has not yet been
allocated to the Allotments Committee could it be used for a
children's playground? I know it would not help all the children, but
it would help some,</quote> she said.
   <p>Councillor W. L. Tarver, Housing Committee chairman, said
the borough surveyor was looking into the playgrounds problem. If any
question of urgency arose during the school holiday, then the surveyor
and the mayor could get together to decide what was best, he added.
<head>NEW OFFICER</head>
   <p>A Midland woman is to be commissioned as a Church Army officer
at a ceremony in London next week.

<head>At 18, Diana has met the Queen, studies in Paris, visits U S
A and SHE'S TO BE A DEBUTANTE AT VERSAILLES</head>
<head>by William Burgess</head>
   <p>SHE was a child when her father took her name and her picture
as the trademark of a business which today has branches across two
continents. She is the symbol of a romance of industry who herself is
fast becoming one of its most efficient practitioners.
   <p>She is Miss Diana Cowpe, 18-year-old daughter of textile tycoon
Mr Eric Cowpe, of Thornton Cleveleys and Anchorsholme, and the
glittering apex of her young career to date will be her <quote>coming
out</quote> celebration at the highlight of the French social season, the
debutantes' ball at the Palace of Versailles.
   <p>The Cowpe family came to live here seven years ago from Burnley,
where blossomed the business which today supplies the demands of
customers in over 60 different countries.
   <p>Eric Cowpe, debonair industrialist, is the managing director of
the Diana Cowpe Organisation engaged in the production of bedspreads,
bath mats, toilet sets, dressing gowns, housecoats, beach wear and
candlewick by the yard.
   <p>And at the heart of it is the golden girl a fluent linguist, an
expert in public relations, who is fast making herself conversant with
every branch of the industry.
   <p>Today the organisation has over 2,000 employees and uses seven
mills. In 1960 the company further extended its interests by becoming
the United Kingdom distributors for Cannon Mills, who are the world's
largest manufacturers of household textiles.
   <p>In maintaining his global contacts, Mr Cowpe travels on an
average 60,000 miles a year, mostly by air.
   <p>His Fleetwood office, a spot of elegance in inelegant
surroundings, buzzes with ideas and amiability and remarkable for a
high-powered executive, he has not a single ulcer!
<head>Her friends</head>
   <p>Diana is currently enrolled at L'Acad&eacute;mie, 1,000
guinea-a-term plus finishing school in Paris, where her schoolmates
include Miss Charlotte Ford, 19-year-old daughter of car king Henry
Ford 2, and Miss Singer, daughter of the president of the Singer
Sewing Machine firm, whose wedding incidentally she will soon be
attending in New York.

   <p>In a few weeks' time Miss Singer and a party will be coming to
stay with the Cowpes in Norbreck-road.

   <p>Diana who will be 19 in May, is staying with La Comtesse de
la Forest Divonne, in the Avenue de Wagram, while she is
attending L'Academie, which is associated with the famed Maxim.
   <p>A finishing school par excellence, its curriculum ranges
over all aspects of French culture.
<head>The programme</head>
   <p>Studies at the Sorbonne include acquaintance with the best of
French civilisation, from history to art, architecture to haute
couture, from the Louvre to the house of Dior, from the drama to
the opera. Not forgetting, of course, la cuisine.

   <p>For the ball at Versailles, there will be a dress from Dior and
an escort from a noted French family.

   <p>This will be a night of nights, with representatives of the
government and leaders of French society as well as a dazzling display
of the world of fashion.
   <p>Ahead lie dates in New York for the Singer wedding, San
Francisco, England, including the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, and a
spell in Madrid.
   <p>Diana was educated originally at Roedean at Brighton, and even at
an early age was already an experienced traveller.
   <p>No playgirl, despite the glitter and the globe-trotting, she has
kept a shrewd eye on the family business, worked hard both at home and
abroad at public relations.

   <p>At the Earl's Court Exhibition, where the company was
represented, she was presented to the Queen, and there was an informal
chat.

   <p>The incident was later seen on television, and father records
that his daughter was a good deal more composed than he was. A
photograph of this occupies pride of place on his desk in the
Fleetwood office.
   <p><quote>Since she was very young,</quote> says her proud father, <quote>she has
always taken a great interest in the business, and that is why I chose
her for the company's trade name. I have confidence in her ability.
A great girl!</quote>
<head>In Switzerland</head>
   <p>After Roedean, she went to another school at Neuchatel in
Switzerland has already visited the United States and studied
production in the mills of the <quote>Deep South.</quote>

   <p>Last November Mr Cowpe had further proof of his daughter's
versatility when she won golden opinions for her performance in
<quote>Invitation to Saturn,</quote> a new play by Lady Aylwen, which was
presented at the Scala in London in aid of the Greater London Fund for
the Blind.

   <p>Small wonder that father has a wealth of photographs of his
daughter, among which the one reproduced on this page takes pride of
place. It was taken by Stara, noted French photographer of Paris and
Cannes, whose pupils included the late great English photographer
Baron.
   <p>Diana Cowpe is a young lady on her way, and an example of beauty
and brains in this modern age.
<head>Spoke about colour bar</head>
   <p><quote>WE are trying to bring about equal rights for all civilised
men,</quote> said the Rev E. Thornley, the northern area secretary for
the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, when he spoke to members
of the St Chad's Church of England Men's Society on Monday.
   <p>Mr Thornley asked, <quote>What is the colour bar?</quote>
   <p>He said that there were many forms. The first was a local colour
bar, such as was found in the Union of South Africa and which was
known as apartheid.
   <p>Mr Thornley said that apartheid was revolting, and although the
basis of it was theology it was rank bad theology.
   <p>Another type of colour bar was the economic form which existed in
the Federation and which also formed the basis for the colour bar in
the United States.
   <p>The third form was the social colour bar which, said Mr
Thornley, was pretty well universal.
   <p><quote>Our mission is striving to create a multi-racial community
where all may enjoy fundamental rights and responsibilities, and where
a man's status and opportunities depend not on the colour of his skin
but on his character and competence,</quote> he added.
   <p>Mr S. Holden, chairman, presided and Mr F. Shaw thanked
Mr Thornley.
<head>Inspiration in a garage</head>
<head>A PEN picture of Bispham artist Miss Kate Smith by MAUREEN
McCONVILLE</head>
   <p>FROM the outside, and on first glance, the garage at 19,
Stainforth-avenue, Bispham, looks like any other garage.
   <p>But there the resemblance abruptly and completely ends.
   <p>Inside, in an atmosphere pungent with linseed oil and turpentine,
it is furnished for use with fluorescent lighting supplementing the
daylight from the large windows, and for comfort with thick matting on
the floor, curtains and chairs.
   <p>Inside, the ordered chaos of artistic activity prevails.
<head>Centrepiece</head>
   <p>Even to the uninitiated, this building, masquerading as an
ordinary suburban garage, is a working artist's studio.
   <p>The working artist to whom it belongs is Kate Smith, three of
whose pictures have been hung as the centrepiece of the Lancashire Art
Exhibition, which opened at the Harris Gallery, Preston, on Wednesday.
   <p>Miss Smith came to Blackpool from the Midlands in April last
year and this is the first time she has exhibited in Lancashire.
   <p>It is not, by a long way, her first experience of exhibiting, for
Miss Smith has been painting most of her life, striving to express in
oils on hardboard the ideas that come too fast for her to cope with.
<head><quote>Imaginative</quote></head>
   <p>She has little of the exhibitionism that people associate with
artists. Instead of producing a facile flow of ideas about artistic
theory and personal aims, she gropes for words to express her sense of
the seriousness of painting.
   <p>She knows what she believes and feels about art, but she handles
language with something less than the complete assurance with which
she handles paint.
   <p>Considering whether she qualified as a <quote>modern</quote> artist or
not, she told me: <quote>I'm just an imaginative painter, really.</quote>
   <p>This modest personal appraisal needs elaboration.
<head>Bible-inspired</head>
   <p>Many of Miss Smith's paintings are inspired by incidents in the
New Testament and express divine and human qualities in the life of
God-made Man.
   <p>The expression is achieved by a heavy reliance on symbolism,
which simplifies, concentrates and distorts reality to make the
symbolism clear and powerful.
   <p>The result is far from traditional, though it has nothing of the
shock value of, say, action painters and other anti-humanists.
<head>Striking</head>
   <p>In fact, the human feeling in her paintings is one of their
most striking aspects and one which has gained her adherents in
unexpected quarters.
   <p>Coming to Blackpool has influenced her choice of subject to
some extent, though now, she told me, she was returning to
<quote>religious</quote> work.
   <p>In her studio, I saw several pictures directly inspired by the
local scene. One was a composite of Blackpool's pleasures, another a
colourful sketch of the Illuminations.
<head>Rhythmic</head>
   <p>One I particularly liked was a study of three girls preparing
to swim. The rhythmic flow of their bodies made an interesting and
satisfying composition.
   <p>Horses from the Tower Circus were featured on a small painting
full of vigour and delight in movement.
   <p>Miss Smith has taught painting &mdash; in sanatoriums, which inspired
one of the paintings now exhibited in Preston, and in mental
hospitals &mdash; but it has always been her aim to be a full-time painter.
   <p>Now she has achieved it. She paints all through the day every
day, starting at 8 a m, taking time off for lunch, and working
until 6 p m.
<head>Month to paint</head>
   <p>A full-sized picture takes about a month to complete and
afterwards, she relaxes for a few days before starting another.
   <p>Soon she will be employing one of her relaxation periods for
another sort of painting. She is going to decorate her sittingroom.
   <p><quote>It will be my first attempt,</quote> she told me.
<head>RED LIGHT PLAIN TO ALL</head>
<head>BY <squote>ZEPHYRUS</squote></head>
   <p>AT last people are genuinely worried. One resignation, two
resignations, even three resignations from the Blackpool Town Council
they were prepared to accept as more or less normal wastage.
   <p>But when, last week, the total rose to six with the impending
departure of Marton's 70-year-old Coun James Shepherd Leigh,
ratepayers suddenly recognised as a very real thing the red light
which this column has been flashing for months.
   <p>At function after function this week I am told, it has been said,
<quote>The situation is serious. We can't afford to lose experienced
administrators at this rate.</quote>
<head>Of course not</head>
   <p>Well, of course we can't. What is more, unless the political
parties themselves are prepared to admit that one way or another the
rot must be stopped, local government in Blackpool could be in trouble
before very long.
   <p>How can the parties help? Obviously, I should think, by taking
their councillors on one side and telling them it is time they started
behaving like intelligent adults.
   <p>Members of the council are not unaware why many of their
colleagues are quitting the municipal scene, or why quite a number of
others are sick to the teeth.
   <p>They know, as one or two have said publicly, that they are going
because they feel that under the existing set-up it is well nigh
impossible to have even the most insignificant questions discussed
without the political and personal element creeping into them.
<head>Disunity</head>
   <p>Indeed, disunity has become a matter for joking.
   <p>The other day eight members of the Estates and Housing Committee,
and four Corporation officials, made the long journey into
Staffordshire to inspect some old people's housing schemes.
   <p>The outward journey was halted for morning coffee, and I hear
that when councillors saw the name of the hotel one of them wanted to
know if, in making the arrangements, a Town Hall official had tried to
be sarcastic.
   <p>The name of the hotel? <quote>The Good Companions</quote>!
   <p>By themselves, committees function reasonably well.
   <p>It seems to be when committees join forces and become either the
General Purposes Committee or a public meeting of the Town Council
that feathers begin to fly.
   <p>All hail, therefore, to one of the most recent proposals to come
out of the Town Clerk's Department.
<head>Scrapped</head>
   <p>It is &mdash; as long advocated by this column &mdash; that the General
Purposes Committee as at present constituted (it consists of all
members of the council) should be scrapped, and replaced by a more
compact and workable body.

is needed for the compulsory acquisition of property.
   <p>Block valuation given by the district valuer for the new dock

<head>Lower profits from motor cycles</head>
   <p>The reimposition of the credit controls and the wet summer of
1960 had a particularly adverse effect on the activities of motor
cycle dealers and resulted in a fall in the group profits of Jenkin
and Purser (Holdings), before tax, from &pound;82,545 to &pound;36,091 during
the year ended September 8 last.
   <p>Although much of the group's business is effected on hire
purchase terms, the company's experience in this respect has been
satisfactory, as the machines sold to retail customers on credit are
retained as security until fully paid for.
   <p>In his statement, the chairman emphasises that in any event the
group's reserves are adequate to meet all contingencies.
   <p>The board have recommended a total distribution of 10 per cent.
less tax, against 22 1/2 per cent. previously, while the chairman
refuses to forecast future business as current turnover continues <quote>to

<head>Markets are irregular</head>
<head>LONDON</head>
   <p>AFTER making a hesitant start to the New Account, stock
markets have taken some encouragement today from the trade figures,
which are better than expected, and quietly irregular conditions
prevail.
   <p>Gold shares are very firm despite the sharp fall in the gold
price following the U.S. ban on gold hoarding, sentiment being
encouraged by the belief that Americans will switch from gold into
gold shares.
   <p>There is a widespread advance in gold share prices, ranging
6d. to 5s., the latter seen in F. S. Geduld.
   <p>Industrials are mixed, but with sentiment helped by a
favourable reading of the trade figures. The leaders have rallied
from a dull start. Glaxo, however, remain a depressed spot at 60/10
1/2 on the cut in selling prices.
   <p>Textiles are firm on talks of further possible mergers, with good
gains by Bleachers and Bradford Dyers. Stores have recovered part of
their earlier falls.
   <p>Steels are often a few pence easier but a number of firm spots
are seen in engineerings. Buildings have gone ahead.
   <p>Oils are firm with Shells strong.
   <p>New prices quoted today:

<head>BIRMINGHAM</head>
   <p>Modest improvements in engineering today include Radiation
34/9, Wolseley-Hughes 49/-, Smith's Stamp. 30/-, Wilkins and Mitchell
13/4 1/2xd., Midland Bright 14/-, Midland Iron 5/9, Duport 12/10 1/2
and Cope Allman 22/3.
   <p>Guest new have been bought at 44/3. Clarksons, however, have
dipped to 28/3 and Valor 15/-.
   <p>B.M.C. have shed 6d. to 15/6, and Rovers 3d. to 14/7
1/2, but Standards are hard at 10/6, while S. Smith are supported at
17/4 1/2.
   <p>Stores are a fairly strong counter, with Wigfalls outstanding at
32/-. Susan Small look well at 29/-.
   <p>Albrights are 25/3 and Baggeridge Brick 8/9.
<head>HIGHER PROFITS AND PAYMENT BY EDGE TOOL</head>
   <p>Good results are announced by Edge Tool Industries, of
Wolverhampton.
   <p>Group profits, before tax, for the year to September 30, are
reported at &pound;223,878, compared with &pound;147,126 previously, with tax
taking &pound;109,260 against &pound;68,829, net profits come out at &pound;114,618,
against &pound;78,297.
   <p>Allocation to reserves is &pound;10,000 against &pound;7,000, and &pound;1,001
against nil is written off trade marks. The loss of exchange-turning
on the company's Brazilian Subsidiary was &pound;1,415 against &pound;1,250.
   <p>Edge Tool's final dividend is maintained at 12 1/2 per cent.,
but it means a total payment of 20 per cent., against 17 1/2 per
cent. &mdash; the interim having been raised from 5 per cent. to 7 1/2
per cent.
   <p>The Brazilian subsidiaries' figures are not consolidated with
the results of the home companies in the group, but the figures show
that the Brazilian company has another good year with net profits up
from 9,700,000 cruzeiros to 10,500,000 cruzeiros.
   <p>Home companies in the group include Chillington Tool Co.,
Edward Elwell, Ltd., and Midland Heat Treatments.
   <p>The annual meeting will be held on February 10. Mr. H. W.
Hunt is chairman.
<head>Dividend increased by P. J. Evans</head>
   <p>An increase in trading profit from &pound;78,648 to &pound;100,648, and a
2 1/2 per cent. rise in the dividend total for the year to September
30, 1960, are reported by P. J. Evans, the Birmingham motor
vehicle distributors.
   <p>Following the higher 7 1/2 per cent. (5 per cent.) interim,
the final is being maintained at 15 per cent.
   <p>After depreciation, etc., of &pound;18,378 (&pound;16,442) and tax
&pound;42,514 (&pound;31,739), the net profit is up from &pound;30,467 to &pound;39,756.
The carry-forward is &pound;99,613 (&pound;76,395).

   <p>The directors of Concentric Manufacturing Co. announce
that of the 1,020,000 Ordinary 2s. shares offered to shareholders on
a rights basis at 10s. a share, 994,910 shares, representing 97.5
per cent. of the total, have been taken up on the rights terms.
   <p>The remaining 25,090 shares have been sold in accordance with the
terms of the issue for the benefit of the company.
<head>HANDFORD GREATREX</head>
   <p>It is understood that terms of a counter-bid for the Ordinary
shares of Handford Greatrex and Co., of Walsall, producers of
upper leather and hide processors, may be put before Ordinary
shareholders this week.
   <p>Behind the counter-bid are understood to be Mr. Bernard Owens,
a Birmingham insurance broker, and Mr. Alan G. Higgs, a Coventry
businessman.
   <p>Meanwhile, Harvey and Sons, tanners and curriers, of Nantwich
and Bury, have announced (as reported in the <quote>Express and Star</quote> on
Saturday) that, having received acceptances in excess of 65 per
cent., they have declared unconditional their offer for the Ordinary
capital of Handford Greatrex. The share exchange offer is worth about
12s. a share, and the final date for acceptances has been extended
to February 28.
   <p>Mr. G. Greatrex, chairman of Handford Greatrex, said today
that shareholders would have a full opportunity to consider both
offers. He and his family and other directors control more than 60
per cent. of the company's shares and have recommended other holders
to accept the Harvey offer.
   <p>The &pound;90,000 capital includes &pound;50,000 in Ordinary shares.
<head>Company reports</head>
   <p>The Volkes Group, a holding company of manufacturers of
filtration and silencing equipment and specialised engineering
products, is raising the interim dividend from the equivalent of 4.58
per cent. to 5 1/2 per cent. on a capital increased by a
one-for-five scrip issue. The total equivalent distribution for the
year ended March 31, 1960, was 15.42 per cent.
   <p>Group profits, before tax, of R. B. Pullin and Co.,
electrical engineers and scientific instrument makers, increased
from &pound;316,990 to &pound;361,309 for the year to September 30, 1960.
   <p>The previous year's effective 25 per cent. dividend total is
maintained with an unchanged 20 per cent. final. The 5 per cent.
interim for the previous year was paid prior to a two-for-five rights
issue.
   <p>Tax takes &pound;170,247, against &pound;167,131, leaving the net balance
up from &pound;149,859 to &pound;191,062.

<head>Gold price lowest for six weeks</head>
   <p>President Eisenhower's order forbidding U.S. citizens to
hold gold overseas brought a sharp fall in price on the London bullion
market today.
   <p>At today's official fixing by the five leading dealers, it was
cut by 2s. 4d. per fine ounce &mdash; the lowest point for six weeks.
   <p>The dollar equivalent is 35.43 against the U.S. official
price of 35 dollars.
   <p>The fall is the biggest recorded at a fixing since October 27
when, after the City's big gold rush passed its peak, the price dipped
6s. to 254s.
   <p>The dramatic U.S. move to check the flow of gold from
America was a top talking point in the City today. It sparked off
selling in a market devoid of buyers, until the price went down. Then
buyers came in.
   <p>The market later became steadier, and the price rose to around
253s. on further buying.
   <p>Of the Eisenhower ban &mdash; announced over the weekend and six days
before he leaves office &mdash; one big dealer said: <quote>In all probability
it will create a certain amount of panic selling by Americans.
   <p><quote>It is also going to strengthen the views of outsiders that
devaluation of the Dollar, in their opinion, is imminent. So there
may well be a return of heavy buying by them. This would push the
price up.</quote>
<head>Accountants say: <squote>Abolish Schedule A</squote></head>
   <p>The abolition of the Schedule A tax on owner-occupied
residential properties is among a number of tax recommendations made
to Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by the
Association of Certified and Corporate Accountants, for his
consideration prior to the Budget.
   <p>The association says that while it recognises that abolition of
Schedule A would involve a loss of revenue, there would be
considerable administrative savings.

<head>CREAM OF VOICES PITCH TOO HIGH FOR US</head>
<head>By ALAN BENDLE</head>
   <p>NONE of the singers who has already won through to the rank
of international artist will be with the Covent Garden Company when it
opens its week's visit to Manchester on Monday.
   <p>As Sir David Webster, the Garden's general administrator, has
been pointing out, the reasons are two &mdash; the international artists
have too many engagements elsewhere and they are too expensive. The
company cannot afford to hire them for touring.
   <p>I asked Sir David to make the second reason even plainer. How
much must the company pay for the services of one of the great ones, a
Callas, a Gobbi, a Christoff, and nowadays a Joan Sutherland or a
Geraint Evans?
   <p>He shrugged his shoulders. <quote>Anything from &pound;300 to &pound;800,</quote> he
said. <quote>Oh, yes, for one performance.</quote>
   <p>It is therefore on real hard cash that he bases his argument that
if Manchester is ready to pay the top price of, say, 25s. a seat,
and fill the theatre, Manchester can expect more of the world-famous
ones &mdash; always provided that her claims do not unhappily conflict with
those of La Scala, New York's Metropolitan Opera, Vienna, Venice,
Paris, San Francisco, and the rest of the world's leading opera
houses.
   <p>The career of an international opera singer is not a particularly
long one. The harvest of fame must be collected in some 15 years at
most, and to-day, with the tax-gatherer in hot pursuit, no-one is
likely to rival the fortune of a Caruso or a Melba.
   <p>
   <p>THERE is a more sensible attitude than that adopted by some
of Manchester's opera fans.
   <p>Taking recent years as an example, Joan Sutherland may now be
shuttling between the States and Italy; Canadian Jon Vickers may have
been stolen away by New York and Chicago; and Geraint Evans may be
conquering Vienna, but we have heard them all in the near past.
   <p>And there are singers with us next week who are destined for
world renown but are still here to be listened to. Why should we let
nostalgic longings spoil the pleasure of picking out to-morrow's world
favourites?
   <p>Let us, like the gentlemen of the Turf, choose half a dozen to
follow. My own list is: soprano Joan Carlyle (<quote>Der
Rosenkavalier</quote> and <quote>Boheme</quote>); soprano Marie Collier
(<quote>Boheme</quote>); bass Michael Langdon (<quote>Der Rosenkavalier</quote>);
mezzo-soprano Josephine Veasey (<quote>Carmen</quote> and <quote>Peter Grimes</quote>);
and baritone David Ward (<quote>Aida</quote>).
   <p>
   <p>THAT admirable singer Michael Langdon has one passion that
must endear him to a wider public.
   <p>When he is not using his voice as Baron Ochs in <quote>Der
Rosenkavalier</quote> &mdash; he sang the role at Covent Garden in November and
repeats it in Manchester &mdash; he is putting it to what I believe he
secretly considers an equally good purpose.
   <p><quote>I'm Wolverhampton-born,</quote> he said, <quote>and I try to be free as
often as possible when the Wolves are playing so that I can go and
cheer them on.</quote>
   <p>Well over six feet tall, he has no crowd difficulties in watching
soccer with an expert eye. But he finds his height a handicap when it
comes to his other hobby &mdash; gardening. <quote>The garden,</quote> says Michael,
<quote>is such a long way down!</quote>
   <p>He has been with the company for 13 years, and already in 1950
was singing solo roles. The drunken monk Varlaam, in <quote>Boris
Gudonov,</quote> gave him a notable start, and the Grand Inquisitor, in
<quote>Don Carlos</quote> &mdash; as one of the cast that included Tito Gobbi and
Boris Christoff &mdash; was his biggest break.
   <p>He went to Vienna last year to study Baron Ochs under Alfred
Jerger, who had sung the part with Richard Strauss conducting. He has
achieved a ripe humour without clowning, and as a result is to sing
the Baron with the Hamburg State Opera.
   <p>
   <p>IS the Covent Garden tour repertory too familiar?
   <p>Well, you know what happens when a new work appears &mdash; an
inevitable and heavy financial loss.
   <p>When <quote>Peter Grimes</quote> made its first appearance in Manchester
the house was half-empty. On its second visit there was a slight
improvement. Next week what will the answer be?
   <p>The same thing happens in London. This season is the first in
which <quote>Peter Grimes</quote> has sold out for several performances.

<head>Backing to the front</head>
   <p>SOMETIMES when you listen to a record, the backing, however
unobtrusive it may be, attracts your attention more than the singer.
   <p>I mean no slight on Mr. Gary Miller when I confess that this is
what happened when I heard his record <quote>Dream Harbour</quote> (Pye,
7N.15338).
   <p>The accompaniment, a soft, oriental rhythm, came through
entrancingly. It was, I discovered, the work of one of the busiest
back-room boys of the recording world &mdash; Bill Shepherd.
   <p>
   <p>I note that he has credits on two other records this week &mdash;
<quote>Model Girl,</quote> by Davy Jones (Pye, 7N.25072) and <quote>Kookie Talk,</quote>
by Scott Peters (Pye 7N.15343).
   <p>I met Bill for a few minutes just before he began yet another
session for a BBC programme. Chubby, cheerful, duffle-coated and
carrying a bag containing 40 precious band arrangements.
   <p><quote>I've done all sorts of things,</quote> he said. <quote>I was a singer
with a group called the Coronets. I've played a few instruments, and
I was once a journalist. But I'm happy just now to be one of the
people behind the big vocal stars.</quote>
   <p>Bill spends his spare time with the other sort of stars &mdash; his
hobby is astronomy.
<head>She's dead set on singing</head>
   <p>ONE thing about Billie Laine. She has got determination.
   <p>So much of it that you feel that if she set her mind on swimming
the Channel or breeding champion poodles, or anything, she'd do it.
   <p>As it is she just wants to sing.
   <p><quote>When I was a little girl,</quote> said the 24-year-old shapely miss
from Trinidad, <quote>my mother said I ought to learn to type or do
dressmaking, or something like that. But I wanted to sing &mdash; so I just
sang.</quote>
   <p>She began on the West Indies radio station's equivalent of
Children's Hour. Then she graduated to her weekly programmes.
   <p>She sang in clubs and in concerts, until she looked around one
day and asked herself: <quote>Where do I go from here?</quote>
   <p>The answer was London. With her usual determination she arrived
last July. She didn't know a single soul.
   <p>
   <p>BUT she started to sing &mdash; and that was enough. She has
just made her first record for Philips, called <quote>Kiss Me</quote> (326547,
BF).
   <p><quote>It's a pop song,</quote> she admitted. <quote>And I want to sing jazz.
Jazz, jazz, jazz, that's for me.</quote>
   <p>She called herself Billie (although her real name is Grace) after
her model, her idol, the late Billie Holliday. <quote>There will never be
another like her,</quote> she said.
   <p>Next month Billie makes her first EP &mdash; as a genuine jazz
singer &mdash; with Bill McGuffie providing the backing.
   <p>
   <p>THEY keep burying rock 'n roll &mdash; but it just won't lie
down. <quote>Pony Time,</quote> a fast piece of work by Chubby Checker
(Columbia, 45-DB.4591) and Ray Garnett (R.C.A. 1228) will
probably be as popular here as it is in the States.
   <p>That goes for <quote>Gee Whiz,</quote> by Clara Thomas (London,
HLK.9310), too.
   <p>But my record of the week is the new Bobby Vee one &mdash; <quote>More
Than I Can Say</quote> (London, HLG.9316).
<head>CLASSICAL LOOK</head>
   <p>THOUGH one thinks of Tchaikovsky mainly as a lightly popular
orchestral composer, he did write more than 100 songs, many of them
very fine indeed. But, apart from <quote>None But The Weary Heart,</quote> few
of them are generally known.
   <p>Just how rewarding these songs are may be judged from the
fourteen selected by Boris Christoff in a new LP recital
(HMV ALP 1793). Christoff, whose gifts are well known at Covent
Garden, admirably varies the use of his splendid bass voice to suit
the mood of the songs &mdash; from, for instance, the vigour of <quote>Don Juan's
Serenade</quote> to an enchanting mezza-voce in the gentler moments.
   <p>The value of the disc is enhanced by a phonetic version of the
Russian text, with an English translation alongside.
<head>The <quote>Rose Marie</quote> girl is happy in the swim</head>
<head>Neville Wareham's Show Round-up</head>
   <p>VIRGINIA COURTNEY straightened a strand of coal-black hair,
added a touch to her coppery complexion, and said: <quote>I think my
mother had visions of my swimming the Channel. I could swim before I
ever learned to dance, and I started that when I was three and a
half.</quote>
   <p>Miss Courtney's skin is normally as white as any English city
dweller's, and her hair, she told me, <quote>is really like yours &mdash; an
ordinary, mousy shade.</quote>
   <p>As I straightened a strand of my ordinary, mousy hair, she added:
<quote>The management pays me to keep it dyed as long as I'm playing
Wanda.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>WE were talking in her dressing-room at Manchester's Palace
Theatre, where Miss Courtney is giving an exciting performance as the
sultry Indian girl in <quote>Rose Marie,</quote> and sometimes we had to talk
pretty loudly.
   <p>From a dressing-room down the corridor came the sounds of David
Whitfield limbering up his voice, now almost back to normal volume
after an illness which recently kept him out of the show for two
weeks.
   <p>And from the pipes in the corner came less musical gurglings as
the water from the bathroom upstairs drained away.
   <p><quote>I count the number of baths people have during the evenings,
to be sure there'll be enough hot water left for me,</quote> said Miss
Courtney. <quote>I need that bath badly.</quote>
   <p>She has to wash off the coppery make-up which covers most of her
body, and, particularly on days when there are two performances, that
means a good deal of washing.
   <p>
   <p>BUT Miss Courtney is perfectly happy in any amount of
water, provided it's not too cold. As a child she lived at Herne Bay,
and her mother, a professional swimmer, diver, and dancer, soon had
little Virginia following in her wake.
   <p><quote>I just cannot remember a time when I couldn't swim,</quote> she told
me. <quote>It's quite possible that I might have swum the Channel, though
the longest measured distance I ever covered was only five miles.
   <p><quote>In open water, distance doesn't bother me as long as I can
take my time and just plod on.</quote>
   <p>She is also an expert skin diver, and between dancing and
acting engagements has appeared in big aqua shows and modelled
swim-suits under water.
   <p>While dancing in a <quote>Five Past Eight</quote> revue in Glasgow she was
called on to do some swimming in a Royal Command performance.
   <p>
   <p><quote>IT'S funny,</quote> mused Morton Fraser, <quote>to think that last
year Don Arroll was working for me. And next week he'll be top of the
bill at Manchester Hippodrome with the Harmonica Gang in support.
   <p><quote>Not that I mind at all. He's a very nice lad with a lot of
talent and we're happy to be working with him on this variety tour.</quote>
   <p><quote>All the same the rapid rise of the young comic is a prime
example of the potency of TV, for without his spell as compere of
the Sunday Palladium show, Don Arroll would still be using his
undoubted talent in much lowlier spots on the bill.
   <p>Fraser and his gang have spent most of this week in Manchester,
although their Hippodrome date does not begin until Monday. They have
been working on a new BBC TV musical show which makes its debut
next Saturday, and on Thursday were in Edinburgh for a TV show
with Charlie Chester.
   <p>For the last eight years Fraser has left the stage performances
to his gang, and has concentrated behind the scenes on management
problems and finding a steady supply of bookings.
   <p>
   <p>NOT many people know that his decision to stay in the
background was made at Oldham, and was initiated by an implacable
doctor.
   <p>Fraser told me: <quote>We had been playing Cardiff, and I arrived at
the Oldham Empire with the gang and a dreadfully sore throat.
   <p><quote>The theatre manager sent for a doctor, who told me: <squote>There's
no show for you this week. You're going straight to bed &mdash; unless you
want to be the central figure in a show you won't know anything
about.</squote>

<head>BROTHER JOHN AND THE GRANDAD ROACH</head>
<head>by David Hanington</head>
   <p>THERE are too many fish in the old monks' pool. One
especially is causing Brother John a certain amount of concern. <quote>It
is a roach,</quote> said Brother John, in tones of respectful piety.
<quote>Huge chap. Sometimes we see him swimming about beneath the water
lilies, as big as a submarine.</quote>
   <p>The fish on Brother John's 300-acre estate present a problem,
certainly. But they are unlikely to daunt him. For Brother John has
hooked bigger fish in his time.
   <p>Barrister... coal-miner... flying-officer... farmer...
M.P.... and father of six sons.
   <p>John Faithful Fortescue Platts-Mills is not a Brother in the
monastic sense. His fellow trade-unionists have adopted it as a
nickname, for Mr. Platts-Mills is a staunch union man. He belongs
to the Transport and General Workers' Union. <quote>As a farm worker, I
qualify,</quote> he says.
   <p>Last weekend Brother John threw open the grounds of his
magnificent home near Buxted for a union rally. More than 1,000 union
men and their families arrived to play bowls, eat barbecued chicken
and row on his fish-infested lake.
   <p>Brother John is one of those complex characters &mdash; a landowner
with vigorous Socialist (with a small <quote>s</quote>) theories.
   <p>His energy and enterprise have brought him wealth: he spent the
money from his first big brief in buying a farm in Essex just before
the war. But he still adheres to a strong union outlook. <quote>Property
in Britain is privately owned, so I own property,</quote> he said. <quote>But I
am still in favour of the nationalisation of land for all new
buildings.</quote>
   <p>He wore sandals and an open-necked shirt when I met him this
week. His baggy grey flannels were supported by a polka-dot tie
instead of a belt.
   <p><quote>Today is the last day of my holiday,</quote> he explained. (His
<quote>holiday,</quote> incidentally, has consisted of working on his farm with
a vigour which would dismay most other men on the shady side of 50).
   <p>Mr. Platts-Mills's career details read like a plot for a
schoolboy adventure story. He was born in New Zealand, won a Rhodes
Scholarship to Oxford, and got his M.A. (1st Class), and Bachelor
of Civil Law. At Oxford he rowed, played rugby for his college and
was in the Varsity boxing team as a heavyweight.
   <p>He married, and when war started he joined the R.A.F. By
1944 he was a collier in Yorkshire, the first professional man to
become one of the <quote>Bevin boys.</quote> He joined the miners' union, and
in 1945 became M.P. for Finsbury.
   <p>But drastic differences of opinion developed. Platts-Mills
quarrelled with Attlee and Bevin about the stand being taken by the
Government over the Cold War. <quote>I was promoted out of the Labour
Party,</quote> he said, with a wry grin at his own choice of words. For
two years he sat as an Independent Labour member. At the next
election he lost his seat, and has not turned to politics since.
   <p>He still believes, however, in the policy of amity piercing the
Iron Curtain. Brother John is chairman of the British-Soviet
Friendship Society. His four older sons have all walked on
ban-the-bomb marches.
   <p>The house they have lived in for four years is spacious. As
Mr. Platts-Mills explained: <quote>We're tall chaps &mdash; and there are a
lot of us. We need a lot of room.</quote>
   <p>His eldest son, Tim, 24, is a timber worker on the estate. The
others are variously engaged at Oxford, in the manufacturing world,
and as a film editor. The two youngest &mdash; <quote>babies,</quote> their father
calls them, although they are 12 and 10 respectively &mdash; are at boarding
school.
   <p>Mr. Platts-Mills breeds prize pigs &mdash; there are about 300 of
them, &mdash; and they respond admirably to his farming techniques. <quote>They
regard me,</quote> he says, <quote>as one of the family.</quote>
   <p>The other side of his career is as a successful barrister, based
in Temple, E.C.4. He was one of the defending counsel at the
preliminary hearing of the Worthing bank murder case.
   <p>Politics seem far away, as one strolls casually round his lovely
13th century house, formerly a monastery and after that a rectory &mdash;
the Platts-Mills still have to pay an annual tithe for their property.
   <p>But Mr. Platts-Mills is a man of many parts. <quote>It may be that
I may take up politics again,</quote> he said. <quote>But so far I haven't
given it much serious thought.</quote>
   <p>If he does, I imagine Brother John will set about it with the
same determination he shows in every other way: whether he is
directing an impassioned plea in wig and gown, or denouncing
unscrupulous bosses to his fellow-workers.
   <p>I don't envy the future of that grand-daddy roach!
<head>Spotlight on Shoreham Harbour</head>
<head>A VISITOR IN THE VIKING TRADITION</head>
<head>BY CAPT. J. FOGGITT</head>
   <p>WOODEN ships and iron men were the boast of seamen long ago,
and one would be justified in thinking the old adage no longer
applied. But the spirit of those old days was revived at Shoreham
Harbour last weekend when the Norwegian vessel Presthus 2 berthed at
the east end of Aldrington basin.
   <p>Constructed in the manner of the old Viking ships so famous in
the history books, this sturdy little craft of only 118ft. length
and 89 net tons is, except for the engines and accompanying equipment,
built entirely of wood.
   <p>Norwegian built at Rosendal in 1943, the hull is planked with 4
1/2 inch pitch-pine on 6in. by 6in. frames drawing down to a
2ft. by 4ft. keel, frames being spaced from 6in. to a foot
apart.
   <p>There is an inner lining of similar construction to that of the
outer planking, and the space between the two shells is insulated
throughout against the effects of outside temperatures, hatch combings
and covers being built-up and insulated in like manner. Although
designed on trawler lines, she was expressly built for the carrying of
frozen goods.
   <p>She is something more than a refrigerator ship though, and is in
fact a deep freeze carrier. She brought 120 tons of deep frozen
vegetables, mostly peas, from Antwerp to Shoreham for distribution to
the deep freeze food markets. This is a new venture in the port and
this first cargo will open yet another type of trade to Shoreham
harbour.
   <p>Powered by a Norwegian-type diesel engine, this little ship has
made many deep-water passages, crossing the North Atlantic on a number
of occasions to Iceland, Greenland and Canadian ports. There is
something of the Nelson touch about Capt. Gloppholm, the master of
this tough little craft, and his crew of six stalwarts when they tell
of the exciting trips they have made together and the manner of their
boasting of the seaworthiness of the ship in which they serve.
   <p>Although there were complaints of the liveliness of her capers in
heavy weather and of being thrown out of their bunks on many
occasions, they were quick to point out that she is a first-class
sea-boat.
   <p>Apart from the radio and a small Decca set, there are none of the
modern aids to navigation on board so the skipper and his mate must
needs be masters of their craft.
<head>Paper cargo</head>
   <p>Most of the foreign ships this week have been Dutchmen.
Henriette B and Zaanstroom from Amsterdam came to the inner lay-by,
Molensingel loaded spent oxide at the gasworks for Nantes, Equator
brought fir logs from Kristiansund, Norway, to Aldrington Basin for
the Marley Tile Co., and Aerdenhout came from Isnas, Finland, with
timber and paper.
   <p>There was a newcomer to the power station on Wednesday with the
arrival of the B.E.A. collier Cliff Quay, named after the power
station at Ipswich.
   <p>The wine and spirit trades still continue to flourish with the
British m.v. Drake bringing brandy from Tonnay Charente early in
the week and the Spanish m.v. Canton Pequena bringing sherry from
Spain.
<head>Getting up steam for celebration</head>
   <p>RAILWAY enthusiasts are getting up steam for a really
important anniversary celebration &mdash; the 100th birthday of the Shoreham
to Steyning line along which the Steyning Flier, the most famous train
in West Sussex, still puffs every day.
   <p>But, despite the painstaking research which occupies the
leisure hours of the keener enthusiasts, this anniversary nearly
slipped by unnoticed.
   <p>It was 18-year-old Steyning Grammar School boy Michael Keeney,
of Atherton, Jarvis-lane, Steyning, who came upon the fact that the
Shoreham to Henfield railway, via Steyning, opened on July 1, 1861.
   <p>He got to work immediately. He and the headmaster of Steyning
County Primary School, Mr. E. C. G. Lewis, went delving into
the files of newspapers of 100 years ago. Some fascinating facts were
unearthed, which today are not without their touch of humour.
   <p>Take the story of <quote>A Narrow Escape.</quote> It happened shortly
before the track was officially opened, when a ballast train was
chugging down the line. It concerns a character called Humphry of
Henfield, an unfortunate lad who suffered from deafness.
   <p>He was observed 150 yards in front of the engine, walking between
the metals with an eel-spear over his shoulder.
   <p>In dramatic prose, the report takes up the story: <quote>The engine
driver blew his whistle but no heed was taken. Fortunately a
gentleman was on the engine who knew the lad to be deaf so that it
would be impossible by sound to make him aware of his danger. The
brake was applied, and every means used to stop the train, fortunately
with success.</quote>
   <p>The report does not say so, but one hopes that Humphry just kept
on walking between the metals, blissfully unaware of the iron monster
behind him, until, in his own good time, he reached his destination
and put down his eel-spear, waving cheerily to the engine driver as he
passed.
   <p>Facts about the opening ceremony of the line will come in useful,
for schoolboy Michael is hard at work talking British Railways into a
commemoration run with an ancient engine.
   <p>He dreams of prising period costumes from their mothballs in the
railways' museum to be worn by officials on the big day. He may
succeed if enough enthusiasts get in touch with him, and he can
guarantee a train load of guests.
   <p>If it comes off, it should be quite a day, but it is unlikely to
finish with a dinner of the scale provided at the White Horse,
Steyning, 100 years ago.
   <p>Then, 70 or 80 persons sat down. Says a newspaper report: <quote>The
dinner was altogether excellent and the champagne of the finest
vintage.</quote>
   <p>After the loyal toasts, the health of <quote>The Army</quote>, <quote>The
Navy</quote> and <quote>The Volunteers</quote> were successively drunk. Almost as an
afterthought came the toast <quote>Health and success to the directors,
managers and officials of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway
Company.</quote>
   <p>Meanwhile, the Storrington Rifle Band were in action with a piece
called <quote>The Nightingale,</quote> upon which, says the report, the party
broke up.
   <p>The band, preceded by flags, marched again to the station,
followed by a large concourse of people.
   <p>When the train set off <quote>a genuine cheer from Sir George Pompey
was taken up all along the line and repeated again and again, and this
completed one of the jolliest days in the records of Old Steyning.</quote>
   <p>There is only one sad note about it all. Humphry of Henfield
appeared to take no notice.
<head>Commonwealth Exhibition</head>
<head>AND NOW THERE ARE TWELVE</head>
   <p>SIX years ago there were eight independent members of the
Commonwealth. Today there are 12. Who are the other peoples of the
Commonwealth? Why are they so important to us and we to them? What
holds us together?
   <p>For the answers to these and many other questions which vitally
affect the lives of us all you should visit the Commonwealth
Exhibition at Hove, which is divided into seven sections, each
designed to give an insight into the various aspects of the
Commonwealth in our midst and its influence on the lives of each one
of us.
   <p>HOW much do you know about the Commonwealth of the present
day? Almost every day we hear something about its importance to us.
We hear of the wealth and untapped resources of the countries which
belong to it and of their strength and growth.

<text id=LOBA41>
<head>Pat Answers A Fir Park Prayer</head>
<head>MOTHERWELL 5, HIBS 1. (Half-time &mdash; 2-1.)</head>

   <p>DELIGHTFUL! When Motherwell play like this that's the only
possible way to describe them.
   <p>And, glory be, they now have somebody to stick them in the net.
Sure, big Pat Delaney missed some pinches. About a dozen as a
conservative estimate.
   <p>But he scored three goals, laid on one, hit the post with a
header, and had two more net-stretchers disallowed for infringements.
   <p>So altogether you can say Jimmy Delaney's boy had a reasonably
successful afternoon.
   <p>There was a laugh before the start when 'Well skipper Willie
McSeveney came out some 20 yards ahead of his team mates. It looked
for a moment as if he were going to tackle Hibs single-handed.
   <p>From the final score, you might think he could have done, at
that.
   <p>Not so. Until they were latterly demoralised by the jinking
homesters, this was quite a good Hibs team. Lack of forward cohesion
was the rock on which they foundered.
   <p>A Bobby Young <quote>goal</quote> disallowed for offside in the fifth
minute set the game alight.
   <p>But the first legitimate counter went to Hibs. Weir stopped a
Stevenson shot, dropped it, then scooped it out straight to Preston,
who drove home through a crowded goalmouth.
   <p>A deft Delaney header from a McPhee cross restored equality.
Then came tragedy for Simpson, who had executed wonder saves from
Hunter, Delaney, and McPhee. A long, down-the-middle ball eluded
Preston and Delaney. Simpson ran out, completely missed his kick, and
Delaney walked it home.
   <p>After the turn 'Well ran riot. Roberts shivered the bar.
Shots flew everywhere around Simpson's goal.
   <p>Delaney wrapped number three up in silver paper for McPhee.
Next Pat netted an <quote>offside</quote> one. Then he sent Young off, and was
in position to capitalise the youngster's cross. And in the last
minute Pat rocketed home another, only to find the whistle had gone
for a penalty for Baird fouling Quinn.
   <p>Pat Quinn, as is his custom, made no mistake with the spot kick.
   <p>Quinn has been called <quote>the little General.</quote> Here he was a
combination of Montgomery, Napoleon, Horrocks, and all the Generals
you ever heard of.
   <p>Just a hair's-breadth behind was Willie Hunter. Thomson was a
topper, too. And Delaney, of course. But 'Well really hadn't a
failure.
   <p>The home crowd goosed Sammy Baird unmercifully for a few minor
indiscretions. But Sam, along with Grant, Easton, and Simpson, was a
real Hibs stalwart.
   <p>Yes, Simpson. Never mind that second goal. Crowd &mdash; 5500.

<head>LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD &mdash; WITH A HAT-TRICK</head>
<head>DUNFERMLINE ATHLETIC 6, AIRDRIE 2. (Half-time &mdash; 1-0.)</head>

   <p>WHAT a dream debut for young 19-year-old Jackie Sinclair!
Playing his first League game before the home crowd, the ex-Blairhall
junior, who lives in Dunfermline, scored a glorious hat-trick and
fitted into the scheme of things perfectly.
   <p>Sure, he still has a bit to go &mdash; but one thing he CAN do is
put the ball in the net, and that's good enough to go on with.
   <p>Take a good look at the names of the other goal-scorers. Not a
solitary from Messrs Charles Dickson and his inside-forward cronies.
This is no criticism of the trio, but it illustrates how potentially
good this Dunfermline team can be.
   <p>It took them a long time to get the first goal, but the writing
was always on the wall, and once they found the net there was no
stopping them.
   <p>Two Airdrie goals within a minute of each other late in the
second half jolted them, but that was all.
   <p>These goals apart, all Airdrie had to offer was a stout-hearted
defence and excellent sportsmanship. They were outmanoeuvred all
along, but refused to go under and never stooped to a shady action.
   <p>After a first half of frustration, young Sinclair showed the way.
Just on the half-time whistle he hit a Cunningham free-kick past
Dempster close to the near post.
   <p>After the interval, Miller scored the best goal of the game.
Over came a Melrose corner. The left-half ran a good 15 yards from
around the penalty spot and his header flew into the net.
<head>TWO BEAUTIES.</head>
   <p>Then George Peebles decided to take a hand. Within five
minutes he fired a couple of beauties into the net. Sinclair finished
off the Dunfermline scoring.
   <p>First he hit a left-footer cleanly into the net, and then sank
a penalty like a veteran after Shanks had handled his first shot,
which finished over the line.
   <p>Storrie and Hinshelwood were the Airdrie scorers. Both beat
Connachan from around the 20-yard mark.
   <p>No criticism of the Dunfermline defence &mdash; they were never
stretched. All three halves were immense while the forward line,
switching and changing, had a real field day.
   <p>Very few bouquets for Airdrie. Say Johnstone, McNeil, and
Newlands earned pass marks, and that's about it. Crowd &mdash; 8000.

<head>CLYDE STAGE A FADE-OUT</head>
<head>ALBION ROVERS 2, CLYDE 3.</head>
<head>(Half-time &mdash; 0-3)</head>

   <p>FOR the first 15 minutes Clyde showed why they are favourites
for a return to the big time. In that period they shattered Rovers'
defence with three snappy goals.
   <p>But for the remaining 75 minutes they proceeded to show why they
have faltered in recent weeks. Slackness and complacency allowed
Rovers to come right back into the picture with two good goals, and
for the last 15 minutes Clyde were a worried lot.
<head>LEARY STARS.</head>
   <p>Main reason for the sway of fortune centred round Dennis Leary,
the Rovers' pivot. After a disastrous start he found his feet, and
from then on his wing halves, Harvey and McLure, got to grips with the
attack, and the early Shawfield promise faded completely.
   <p>McLaughlin capably led Clyde's attack in the early spell and had
two good goals in 5 and 15 minutes. Between times, big John Colrain,
who finished limping on the wing, got the other goal &mdash; in the 7th
minute.
   <p>Stewart led the Coatbridge rally to score in the 72nd minute, and
Livingstone made up the brace six minutes later. Crowd &mdash; 1000.

<head>UNITED HAD THEIR FANS IN A SWEAT</head>
<head>DUNDEE UNITED 2, STIRLING ALBION 0. (Half-time &mdash; 0-0.)</head>

   <p>ALBION look doomed for a slide back to the second grade.
Certainly they're already playing Second Division football. They
were all triers, but they had no plan, no science, no cohesion, in
fact, not a clue.
   <p>And, worse still, they brought United down to the same dreadful
level. Some of the attempts at ball control and passing were
positively ludicrous.
   <p>For 81 minutes this hopeless spectacle shaped like a goalless
draw because over-anxious United, with all the territorial advantage,
didn't seem to know how to circumvent a desperate defence.
   <p>First <quote>goal,</quote> in six minutes came for Albion from Rowan, but
the winger was obviously offside.
   <p>Somewhat laboriously the Tannadice team built up attack after
attack. There was little fluency in their movements, and certainly no
finish. Carlyle and Gillespie missed inviting chances. Then Neil
Mochan tingled Jim Brown's fingers. Again the goalie saved the Albion
bacon when he fisted over a whizzer from Dennis Gillespie.
   <p>The once-in-a-while Stirling raids came mainly through Kilgannon
and Rowan, for not one of the inside trio measured up to anything like
First Division standard.
   <p>The encouraging Tannadice howl had become a despairing ~<quote>Och,
come on, United</quote> groan before Tommy Neilson made the vocalists happy
by beating Brown.
   <p>Like magic, the strain left the team. Mochan swerved a ball to
Walter Carlyle five minutes later, and the centre settled the
destination of the points.
<head>GORDON IN FORM.</head>
   <p>Good players were extremely scarce. Albion were well served by
Brown and Weir in the rear. Only Myles, Kilgannon, and Rowan made
attacking sorties.
   <p>Of the home lot, Alex. Brown was practically unemployed, Gordon
the best back afield, Neilson the only half-back with any finesse, and
Gillespie the only real footballer in either front line.
   <p>Bonar came by a knee injury and swopped wings with Mochan. This
didn't help to improve the game, which should be quickly forgotten.
Crowd &mdash; 7000.

<head>Tight Defence Foils Morton</head>
<head>ALLOA 2, MORTON 1.</head>
<head>(Half-time &mdash; 1-0.)</head>

   <p>A HARD game, with both sides giving everything they had. The
Wasps had that extra sting, which earned them victory.
   <p>For the first 20 minutes they were on top and Foley gave them a
deserved lead. Then Morton came more and more into the game, but had
nothing to show for it.
   <p>McKenna put Alloa further ahead in the second half in a breakaway
raid. But Easson cancelled that seven minutes later.
   <p>From then it was a question of whether Morton could equalise.
They might have, but poor finishing robbed them of goals. And they
were foiled by a watertight home defence.
   <p>Hodge, E. Docherty, Vint, and J. Docherty all deserve mention
for Alloa with Smith outstanding at centre-forward.
   <p>For Morton, Boyd, Franks, and Cowie stood out in a hard, fighting
combine, and Jackie Ferguson and Allan McGraw can fly back to Germany
feeling they didn't let the side down either. Crowd &mdash; 2000.

<head>TEST MATCH RECORD</head>
   <p>AFTER Ted Dexter had won the toss, England's opening pair,
Geoff Pullar and Peter Richardson, gave them a fine start in the first
test against India at Bombay with an opening partnership of 159.
   <p>This beat the previous best opening against India &mdash; 146 by Pullar
and Gilbert Parkhouse at Leeds in 1959.
   <p>By the close of play England had scored 288 for the loss of three
wickets.
<head>Then Up Popped Patterson</head>
<head>MONTROSE 2, QUEEN OF THE SOUTH 3.</head>
<head>(Half-time &mdash; 2-0)</head>

   <p>MONTROSE sacrificed everything in a bid for two points which
would have hoisted them into second place. Having taken two
first-half goals, they sat back with that <quote>what we have we hold</quote>
attitude.

   <p>What a mistake it proved to be. In seven minutes Queen's
transformed things. Big Jim Patterson banged in a goal eight minutes
from time. Three minutes later he nodded in another for the
equaliser. Then McMillan and Martin pulled off a dramatic winner
between them.

   <p>What was the Montrose defence doing all this time? The three
goals followed the same pattern &mdash; crosses from the wings. First two
were from corner kicks. All three might have been cleared.
   <p>But if the home supporters became critical over the defence they
should really lambast those forwards who were shot-shy against a
strong Queens defence starring McTurk and Rugg. Take Frank Sandeman
out of the attack &mdash; especially second half &mdash; and there would not have
been a try from the lot of them.
   <p>Queens had some excuse in that Patterson &mdash; delayed in arrival
because of fog &mdash; was obviously not fully fit. He pottered about on
the right wing for 85 minutes and did all the damage in that
three-minute burst. Until then Phil Grieve scarcely had a save.
Crowd &mdash; 2000.
<head>FIGHTING FORFAR</head>
<head>FORFAR 2 BERWICK RAN. 2.</head>
<head>Half-time &mdash; 1-2.</head>

   <p>BOBBY LEGGE, the ex-Buckie Thistle inside forward, made an
impressive home debut for Forfar. In addition to clever leading-out
work Bobby, though obviously short of a gallop, scored the goal that
brought his side a point.
   <p>Forfar were the more impressive side in the first half, when Ross
put them ahead in five minutes. Their forward line cut the Berwick
defence to ribbons, but could not get another goal, and gradually
Rangers came more and more into the picture.

   <p>McCulloch (twice) and Imrie both went close before the game
took a dramatic turn in their favour. In an innocuous-looking attack
Knox, on the goal-line, was adjudged to have handled. Right-half
Smith banged home the penalty. He did the same three minutes later
when McCulloch, tearing through, was downed by Berrie.

   <p>To Forfar's credit, they tightened up sufficiently to come back
fighting 20 minutes from the end. In an all-out attack Legge rammed
home the equaliser.
   <p>Berwick carried most danger in their left wing. Forfar's forward
line, good in the first half, tapered off after the interval. Crowd &mdash;
1000.

<head>Stranraer Dominate</head>
<head>STRANRAER 4, BRECHIN CITY 0.</head>
<head>(Half-time &mdash; 1-0.)</head>

   <p>BRECHIN tried hard, but there was only one team in it.
Stranraer dominated throughout, and only forward failings deprived
them of at least another four goals.
   <p>What little football there was, Stranraer played it.

<head>County Gossip</head>
<head>Air Minister Drops In For A Chat</head>
   <p>A ROYAL AIR FORCE helicopter of the Queen's Flight put down
some distinguished visitors to the U.S.A.F. station at Daws
Hill, High Wycombe, on Friday last, chief among whom was the Air
Minister, the Right Hon. Julian Amery.
   <p>Accompanying the Minister on his visit, which also included a
tour of RAF Upper Heyford, were Air Chief Marshal Sir Edmund
Hudleston, Vice-Chief of Air Staff, Sir Maurice Dean, Permanent
Under-Secretary of State for Air, Mr. John Roberts, the Minister's
Private Secretary, Air Marshal Sir Douglas Jackman, Co-ordinator of
Anglo-American relations, Air Ministry, and Squadron Leader Peter
Scott, Personal Air Secretary to Mr. Amery.
   <p>The Secretary of State and his party were greeted by
Major-General Charles B. Westover, Strategic Air Command's 7th Air
Division commander, who talked over with the Minister the command's
activities and mission in the United Kingdom.
<head>Never A Dull Moment</head>
   <p>THE life of a headmistress in school is not all sunshine and
brightness, said Miss K. A. Walpole, of Wycombe Abbey School,
when she presented her last annual report at the school's speech day
on Friday.
   <p>Miss Walpole, who retires at the end of the year, said there were
shadows even for a headmistress, with the care and administration of a
school. But she had loved the life. There was never a dull moment
for the head of a community of 400 or so people.
   <p>One never knew what the next day would bring forward &mdash; it might
be a challenge.
<head>Sad Goodbye</head>
   <p>APPOINTED to the school in 1948, Miss Walpole said it would
mean a sad goodbye to many friends in High Wycombe. She had received
much kindness from borough councillors, education officials in the
county and the Wycombe division, and local school heads.
   <p>Miss Walpole, who told parents and visitors that she could look
back over 40 years in the profession and 27 as a headmistress, heard
words of tribute from Sir Ambrose Dundas, chairman of the school
council.
   <p>Sir Ambrose said that at school speech days Miss Walpole had paid
tribute to staff, girls, parents and members of the council.
   <p><quote>I won't say these tributes are not deserved,</quote> he said <quote>but
you have never once paid tribute to the person to whom a lion's share
is due &mdash; yourself.</quote>
<head>Regiment's Visit</head>
   <p>THE county regiment of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, the
1st Green Jackets, 43rd and 52nd, at present stationed in Wiltshire,
will be visiting the parent counties during September, the <squote>Free
Press</squote> learns.
   <p>Detailed plans are still to be made but it is likely that the
tour will start in Bucks in late August, when a Rifle Company group,
including mortar and anti-tank detachments, will be here for about ten
days.
   <p>There will be public displays and the men of the regiment hope to
challenge local clubs at various sports.
   <p>Supporting the company will be the Regimental Band and Buglers
and a demonstration drill squad. A number of other activities are to
be arranged to coincide with the visit.
<head>Honours List</head>
   <p>VISCOUNT CURZON, chairman of Bucks Education Committee, and
Dr. G. W. H. Townsend, County Medical Officer and Chief
Welfare Officer for Bucks, were congratulated at the June meeting of
Bucks Education Committee on their award of the C.B.E. in
the Queen's Birthday Honours List.
   <p>Col. F. W. Watson said Lord Curzon's honour was one much
deserved, not only for the work he did in the county but outside also.
Lord Curzon offered the committee's congratulations also to Dr.
Townsend.
   <p>Among other awards in the Queen's Birthday Honours were &mdash; Mr.
Frederick Hugh Dalziel Pritchard, Secretary-General of the British Red
Cross, of Gerrards Cross, made a C.B.E.; Group-Captain Angus
Archibald Norman Nicholson, of Lakes-lane, Beaconsfield,
C.B.E.; and Lt.-Col. William Cavendish Carter, R.A.,
of Sandels-way, Beaconsfield, O.B.E.
<head>Now He Is Their Leader</head>
   <p>A MAN who joined the High Wycombe Squadron of the Air
Training Corps as a cadet in 1941, soon after the unit's formation, on
Monday became its new commanding officer.
   <p>Pilot Officer Edward Maddox, aged 36, of 26 Squirrel-lane High
Wycombe, took over command of No. 332 (High Wycombe) Squadron from
Flight Lieutenant Harry Drinkwater, who is leaving the High Wycombe
area after receiving a civil service promotion.
   <p>Pilot Officer Maddox, who is married, with one daughter, left the
A.T.C. with the rank of Leading Cadet in March 1943. He went
straight into the Royal Air Force, did aircrew training in the United
States and received his pilot's wings.
   <p>Towards the end of the second world war he flew unarmed Stinson
Reliant aircraft on communications and air-evacuation flights in the
Burma theatre of operations and left the R.A.F. with the rank
of Warrant Officer Pilot in April 1948.
   <p>In September, 1959, he received a commission in the R.A.F.
Volunteer Reserve training branch and has since served as equipment
officer of the High Wycombe A.T.C. Squadron.
   <p>A technical representative with the High Wycombe firm of Richard
Graefe Ltd., Pilot Officer Maddox is also treasurer of High Wycombe
Wye Valley Angling Club.
<head>Plans For Future</head>
   <p>THE man he succeeds, Flight Lieutenant Drinkwater, lives at
12 Shelley-road, High Wycombe. Married with two daughters and a son
who is a member of the Marlow Squadron of the A.T.C., he is
employed at the High Wycombe Valuation Office.
   <p>Flight Lieutenant Drinkwater, who served as an administrative
officer in the R.A.F. from 1940-46 including tours of duty in
Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Gold Coast is a former adjutant of
Marlow A.T.C. Squadron and a former commander of No. 757
(Vectis) Squadron in the Isle of Wight.
   <p>Present strength of the High Wycombe squadron is well over 40.
There were seven new recruits at Monday's meeting and the unit hopes
next spring to take possession of a new-type cedar hut, designed
specifically for the A.T.C., which will be erected in the
area of High Wycombe Territorial Army barracks.
<head>Musical Barge</head>
   <p>WHEN the American Symphony Orchestra arrive in Marlow on July
15 they will use an 18-foot barge as their auditorium.
   <p>At the Regatta Enclosure at Marlow the 65 musicians will play
from the barge, which has large flaps 100 feet long by 60 feet to
provide a stage depth of 32 feet.
   <p>The craft, built at Dartford for the orchestra's Thames tour
was specially designed to negotiate the river's lock and bridges. It
is also equipped to give a fireworks display after each performance.
   <p>Established at Pittsburg, U.S.A., in 1957, the orchestra
has played in many countries of the world, including Japan, Mexico and
China.
   <p>When the orchestra arrives in Marlow, the musicians hope to be
entertained in the homes of local people. Marlow Urban Council has
given the visit every support and appeals have been made for residents
to entertain the players. So far 60 of the 65 players have been
guaranteed accommodation.
<head>Exchange Visits</head>
   <p>THE 27 teenagers and three adults who are visiting Amersham
from Amersfoort, Holland, at the end of July, for an official
seven-day visit, have been invited to bring over their national
costumes to wear at one of the two parties organised in their honour.
   <p>One of the parties will be on the day after they arrive, on July
22, at Amersham Community Centre. Amersham Ladies' Circle have
offered to provide refreshments on that occasion.
   <p>The other party will be in the form of an official <quote>farewell</quote>
on July 27, the day before they return home. A party of a similar
size will go with them from Amersham for a stay in Amersfoort.
   <p>At the final party Amersham Inner Wheel will provide
refreshments, and plans are being made for an exhibition of Scottish
dancing.
   <p>Finishing touches were this week being put to the programme for
the visitors. Amersham estate agent and historian Mr. L. Elgar
Pike, is taking the party on a history tour of the district by car.
<head>Reading Trends</head>
   <p>ALTHOUGH the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Macmillan, and
other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, have been among the borrowers of
books from Princes Risborough's branch library, the public seems less
keen on reading, the library's annual report reveals. The number of
books issued has dropped by 10,000 compared with last year.
   <p>Closing of the library on Wednesday morning probably accounted in
part for the decrease in the number of books issued, but the extra
morning enabled more time to be given to administrative work, as a
result of which new books have been more quickly circulated, books
needing repair have had more regular revision and readers' requests
have been speeded up.
   <p>More people have been using the library as a source of
information, especially children, and the library has also played its
part in the recreational and cultural life of Princes Risborough.
   <p>Last summer the library served as a point of contact between a
lecturer from Oxford University and people likely to be interested in
a class in modern literature &mdash; and such a class was successfully
launched in the autumn, books for the class being lent from the
library's headquarters.
<head>Social And Personal</head>
   <p>A 21-YEAR-OLD Prestwood man, Mr. Roy Taylor, son of Mr.
and Mrs. J. E. Taylor, of High-street, Prestwood, has gained a
first class honours B.Sc. degree from Leeds University. Three years
ago he won a County Scholarship to the University from Dr.
Challoner's Grammar School at Amersham. He is planning a career in
engineering, starting with a year's spell with a Leeds firm.
   <p>Mr. Brian James Bond, only son of Mr. and Mrs. P. H.
Bond, of Ferry-lane, Medmenham, a former head boy of Sir William
Borlase's School, Marlow, has been appointed tutor in the Department
of History at Exeter University. He graduated at Worcester College,
Oxford, in 1959, and is at present a research student at King's
College, London.
<head>Bright Prospects For A Bigger Wycombe School</head>
   <p>OFFICIALS and supporters of High Wycombe Show, taking heart
from the present brilliant summer weather and the bright forecasts of
more to come, are striving to make this year's show in September
bigger and better than ever.
   <p>It will be the first show since the appointment of the new
secretary, Mr. Wilfred Heritage &mdash; former High Wycombe police
superintendent. And his all-consuming ambition at the moment is to
put the show on to a firm financial footing.
   <p>A bad-weather spell last year cost the show a credit reserve
which had been slowly built up, and a committee was appointed to
explore ways in which funds could be raised during the year. It has
made a good start. But still it must be emphasised that to ensure the
show's continued existence for the general benefit and advertisement
of the town and district, more subscribing members and vice-presidents
are needed.
   <p>Officials feel that they must have a regular income on which to
rely &mdash; lessening their dependence on the weather.
   <p>This year the show will stage the southern area finals of the
<quote>Foxhunter</quote> competition, the winners going on direct to the main
show in London. The Green Jackets will stage a marching band display,
and there will be, among other attractions, a session of American
baseball.
   <p>Already there is a demand for trade stand space, and in the
horticultural section, always a strong feature, there will be some new
exhibits.
<head>New Deputy Chairman</head>
   <p>THE approval of the Lord Chancellor is being sought for the
appointment of Mr. John R. T. Hooper, a well-known barrister
and resident of Chalfont St. Peter, as a deputy chairman of Bucks
Quarter Sessions.
   <p>This was announced by Sir Arthian Davies, chairman, when the
Midsummer Quarter Sessions opened at Aylesbury on Monday. Mr.
Hooper, he said, had been a practicing  barrister for some 20
years and had had considerable judicial experience as an assistant
Recorder and as a member of the Midland Circuit.
   <p>Mr. Hooper lives at Beech Lawn, Chalfont Heights, and earlier
this week was appointed a member of the Beaconsfield magisterial
Bench.
<head>New Tractor His Prize</head>
   <p>A LITTLE MARLOW farmer, Mr. Richard Barnes, of Wood Barn
Farm, will have a very happy visit to the Royal Show at Cambridge on
Thursday, July 6.
   <p>There, on the Dow Agrochemicals Ltd. stand, he will meet Ted
Moult, farmer and B.B.C. personality, to be presented with the
first prize which he has won in the ~<quote>Know Your Enemy</quote> competition
organised by the agricultural chemical firm.

<text id=LOBA43>
<head>Carlisle men accused of attack on girl</head>
   <p>A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD girl's evidence was heard in camera
by Wigan magistrates on Wednesday when three Carlisle men were charged
with an offence against her.
   <p>The magistrates (Mr. E. Routledge and Mr. J. Holiday) sat
all day listening to evidence in the case against John Earl (28) a
painter, address given as 16 Brookside, Raffles; Eldon Edward Cole
(25), labourer, address given as 32 Castle Street, and Lawrence Dixon
(22), labourer, address given as 87 Dalton Avenue, Raffles.
   <p>The case was adjourned until August 16th because a witness from
the N.W. Forensic Laboratories at Preston, was unable to attend.
   <p>The men who were represented by Mr. Lionel Lightfoot, Carlisle,
appeared, on remand, and their bail in the sum of &pound;50 each was
extended.
   <p>Mr. A. Carr, Wigton, prosecuting said that the girl met Dixon
at a fair earlier and went for a walk with him. He pulled her down
and interfered with her clothes inspite of her struggles and pleas.
They walked back to the fair together, and she later agreed to him
taking her home. When they reached the Silloth Cafe the other two
accused drew up in a van and said they would give her a lift home.
She refused because she did not like the other two.
<head><quote>LIFTED INTO VAN</quote></head>
   <p>As she was walking up the street the van stopped beside her and
one of the men lifted her into it and shut the door. She did not have
time to shout or struggle and the van drove off.
   <p>Mr. Carr alleged that all three men committed offences against
the girl in the van despite her protests and struggles.
   <p>The girl was taken on to Carlisle and Cole told her she had
better stay at his place for the night, and there Mr. Carr alleged,
Cole committed two more offences against her. She was taken to the
station on Sunday and given 7/6d for her fare home.
   <p>When the three were charged they all denied the offence.
<quote>But</quote> added Mr. Carr, <quote>evidence is available which corroborates
the girl's account.</quote>
   <p>Dr. Robert M. Yule, of Silloth said in evidence that he
examined the girl on July 9, and the result of his examination could
be compatible with rape.
<head>REPORTED MISSING</head>
   <p>Constable James Armstrong said that the girl was reported
missing by her parents at 1 a.m. on Sunday July 9. A search was
made, but she was not found until she was seen walking towards her
home having come off the afternoon train from Carlisle.
   <p>Interviewed, Dixon made a statement which was put in as evidence
and the Constable alleged that Cole said that he had a clear
conscience.
   <p>Constable G. Lowther alleged that Earl told him that he had not
touched the girl. They had gone to the fair in Silloth on the
Saturday night and his pal <quote>Lol</quote> (Dixon) picked up a girl. They
took her with them to Carlisle in the back of the van. They stopped
at a cafe and <quote>Collo</quote> (Cole) took her a cup of tea and some
biscuits. He (Earl) offered to take her back to Silloth but she said
it was too late to go home and she went into the house with
<quote>Collo</quote>. They put her on the 1 p.m. train for Silloth. The
Constable added that when he cautioned and charged Earl with an
offence against the girl he said he had nothing to say.
<head>USED BARN AS PLAYGROUND, YOUTHS FINED</head>
   <p>FIVE youths who made a Sunday night playground of farmer
Anthony Dalzell Spedding's barn at Mill Hill, Cleator Moor, were
severely punished by Whitehaven Bench on Thursday.
   <p>In fines, restitution and special costs, they were each ordered
to pay a total of &pound;5 7s 2d, and told by the chairman, Mr.
Jos. D. Miller, <quote>You must have respect for other people's
property. You had no right to be there and, indeed, were trespassing,
and damage like this is a serious matter for a farmer.</quote>
   <p>William Dobson, aged 18; Dennis Smith (17), of Devon Road,
Hensingham and three sixteen-year-olds denied doing wilful damage to a
hay mew, estimated at &pound;10.
   <p>Mr. Spedding told the Court that on Sunday night, July 2, when
he and his family were returning home from a visit to friends, he
heard a disturbance in the barn and tried to catch the culprits.
<quote>Three or four young men rushed out of the barn and got away,</quote> he
said.
<head>FOUND IN BARN.</head>
   <p>The following Sunday night there was a similar incident in the
barn.
   <p><quote>I telephoned for the police,</quote> said Mr. Spedding, <quote>and when
P.C. Vallance arrived we entered the barn and found these lads
there. About 30 or 40 bales of hay had been pulled down and were
scattered over the barn. Much of the hay had to be rebaled and it
took my son and I all day on Monday to get the place in order
again.</quote>
   <p>P.C. Joseph Vallance stated that all five were on top of the
mew <quote>jumping about</quote> and a large amount of hay was loose and
trampled.
   <p>One of the defendants told the Magistrates <quote>We thought we'd
just have a laal bit of fun in the barn. We didn't do all that
damage. The farmer's wife said it could have been done by some boys
who had pulled down dykes before.</quote>
   <p>None of the other four gave evidence in support of their <quote>not
guilty</quote> plea.
<head>Cleator Moor wants a swimming bath</head>
   <p>CLEATOR Moor's claims for a swimming bath to serve the
whole Ennerdale Rural District were put forward by Coun. John
Collighan at Monday night's meeting of the parish council.
   <p><quote>I feel we are the most central for the Frizington, Arlecdon and
southern areas,</quote> he said. Referring to Egremont, who are also in
the running for the baths, he added <quote>I do not want there to be any
feeling of jealousy between the two towns in this.</quote>
   <p>A letter from Mr. G. S. Bessey, Cumberland Director of
Education stated that the County Youth Committee could not support
Cleator Moor's claim but wished to know of developments. Remarked
Councillor Collighan: <quote>I feel we will get no help from the County
Council, except on the planning side.</quote>
   <p>He thought they would get help from Ennerdale R.D.C., if
that Council agreed there should be a swimming bath in its area.
<head>IN OLD MARKET?</head>
   <p>The Clerk, Mr. Ian Brown, recalled that it had been suggested
that the old covered market might be suitable. Proceeds from the
pending sale of Bowthorn Recreation Ground could be devoted to the
cost of the baths.
   <p>It was agreed to forward the suggestions to Ennerdale
R.D.C.
   <p>It was decided to ask the R.D.C. to adopt a by-law
prohibiting parking on Cleator Moor Market Square. Coun. Collighan
said there had been an improvement on the square, where the buses were
now parking at the rear instead of in front of the library.
<head>Broke windows <quote>for daftness</quote></head>
   <p>THE quarter-inch thick plate glass window of a
confectioner's shop in Whitehaven Market Place was shattered by a blow
from 24-years-old Edward Orr, 3, Cart Road, Ginns, late on Monday
night &mdash; the first day of his annual holiday from work!
   <p>The crash was heard by young P.C. Fallowfield, walking home
in civilian clothes, said Supt. Edward F. Nixon in Whitehaven
magistrates' Court on Thursday when Orr pleaded <quote>guilty</quote> to the
damage, and to being drunk and disorderly.
   <p>With him was William John James Cavanagh (26) of 41, Fell View
Avenue, Woodhouse, who admitted a breach of the peace.
   <p>P.C. Fallowfield showed the men his warrant card, continued
Supt. Nixon, and questioned them about the incident. They became
<quote>difficult,</quote> refused their names and addresses, and a passing
motorist was requested to find assistance for Constable Fallowfield.
   <p>P.C. Benn joined him, and Orr, who was by that time
aggressive, was arrested. Cavanagh tried to interfere with the police
and, before Orr was taken into the police station, he had become
violent.
   <p><quote>I did it for daftness, I can't remember a thing about it,</quote>
Orr said, referring to the broken window. He was ordered to pay fines
and damages amounting to &pound;15 and Cavanagh was fined &pound;2 for breach of
the peace.
<head>New Minister for Wigton</head>
   <p>THE Rev. Ferdinand Arnold Nicholson, at present
Congregational minister at Tillingham and Steeple, Essex, has been
appointed as new minister to Wigton Congregational Church, and he
takes over his new living on Sunday Nov. 5th.
   <p>Before training for the ministry at Edinburgh University and the
Yorkshire United Independent College, Bradford, Mr. Nicholson, who
is 70, spent nine years with a Hull firm of Chartered accountants. He
has been a minister to nine churches having been called to his present

<head>Boltongate garden fete</head>
   <p>THE annual garden fete held in aid of the Boltongate Church
funds last Saturday was again a big success and it brought in &pound;178.
It was at Quarry Hill by permission of Mr. and Mrs. G. E.
Shaw.
   <p>The fete was opened by Mrs. M. Peat, of Silloth. She was
introduced by Mr. Shaw and thanked by Mr. R. Brame and Miss
Grindley, and also presented with a flowering plant by Miss Brenda
Messenger. Buttonholes were presented to other members of the
Committee by Jean Armstrong, Gillian Robinson, Christine Moore, Hazel
Carruthers, Sylvia Temple, Anne Tudhope and Audrey Armstrong.
   <p>The fancy dress carnival comprised three classes for the
prettiest, comic and most original. It drew 18 competitors and was
judged by Mrs. Peat.
   <p>The goods on various well filled stalls were sold quickly, teas
were provided and children's sports followed.
<head>Holding on</head>
   <p>PAINTER Joe Jackson, aged 41, rode a pedal cycle up
Egremont main street with his small son <quote>clinging to his back and
holding on to him by the neck,</quote> Whitehaven Bench heard on Thursday.
   <p>When Sergt. Holdsworth stopped him and told him he would be
reported Jackson, who lives at 9, The Crescent, Smithfield, replied:
<quote>I am going to see the Inspector. You have got it in for me.</quote>
   <p>Jackson was not in Court when fined &pound;1 for being one of two
persons carried on a pedal cycle not adapted for the purpose.
   <p>
   <p>Curious visitors to Frizington main street on July 11 were seven
cows, subsequently claimed by farmer Mossop Irving, of Steele Bank.
<quote>He said he had been unable to repair the fences in the field where
the cattle had been grazing because an accident had disabled him,</quote>
said Inspector Tom Gresham in Whitehaven magistrates court on Thursday
when Mossop was fined 30s for allowing the animals to stray.
<head>LOCAL WEDDINGS</head>

   <p>THERE was a large congregation in St. Joseph's Church,
Cockermouth, on Saturday, to witness the wedding of Miss Brigid
Elizabeth Ball, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E. Ball, of 41, Sullart
St., Cockermouth, to Mr. Derek Cameron, son of Mr. and Mrs.
J. E. Cameron, of Townscroft, Dearham. The Rev. Father Tootall
officiated.
   <p>Given in marriage by her father, the bride wore a gown of French
lace over taffeta, a waist-length veil and coronet and carried a
bouquet of red roses.
   <p>There were four bridesmaids, Miss Freda Cameron, Miss Mary
McKenzie, Miss Eleanor Waling and Miss Margaret Ball. Two were in
lavender and two in blue flock nylon over taffeta. All carried Prayer
Books and flower sprays.

<head>&pound;16 1/2 MILLION ESTIMATES FOR EDUCATION</head>
<head>Cheshire make provision for increased numbers</head>
   <p>IN the next financial year Cheshire Education Committee
proposes to spend &pound;16,499,935, an estimate which represents an
increase of &pound;1,265,710 over the estimated figure for 1960.
   <p>This was agreed at the last meeting of the Committee when it was
stated that the estimated income for the year was &pound;1,459,020. The
difference between this and the expenditure has to be found from rates
and taxes.
   <p>Commenting on the proposal, Dr. J. G. Kellett, the County
Director of Education, says that in formulating the estimates for
1961, the Committee has had to make provision, not only for
maintaining and improving the standards in the 568 schools and
colleges throughout the county, but also for the large increase in the
number of pupils in primary and secondary schools, and students
undertaking further education.
   <p>The number of pupils on the roll of primary schools is at present
79,720 and the estimated number next year is 80,755, an increase of
1,035.
   <p>This increase is brought about by the natural increase in the
County's population and also by the continual migration of people into
the County.
   <p>Cheshire is attractive from the point of view of residence, and
the development of industry within the County and in neighbouring
areas means an ever-increasing influx of new population. Added to
this the total population is increased by overspill developments.
<head>SMALLER CLASSES</head>
   <p>However, despite the continuing high level of the primary
school population in Cheshire, considerable progress continues to be
made, as a result of new schools and additional classrooms, in the
direction of the elimination of over-sized classes (i.e. classes
with over 40 on roll).
   <p>Whereas in 1957 the percentage of such classes was 32.9, at
September, 1960, the percentage had been reduced to 23.6. This is the
lowest figure of any year since 1949 and compares favourably with the
year 1953, when the percentage of over-sized classes was 43.2.
   <p>It is noteworthy that the percentage of classes with between 30
and 40 on roll rises steadily and now comprises 38.0 of all primary
school classes. There is also a continued rise in the percentage of
classes with under 30 on roll. In 1953 the percentage of these was
27.7, but at present it is 38.4. The percentage of classes with under
40 on roll grew from the figure of 56.8 in 1953 to 76.4 in 1960.
<head>MORE AT GRAMMAR SCHOOLS</head>
   <p>On the secondary side, the number of grammar school pupils will
increase from 20,163 at present to 21,482 in 1961. The increase is
1,319 pupils, which is the equivalent of two new grammar schools at
over 600 pupils each.
   <p>The number of secondary modern school pupils will remain at the
high level of approximately 33,000. This is due partly to the
<quote>bulge</quote> which continues to pass through the secondary schools, but
also, as in the case of primary schools, to the migration of
population into the County and to the increasing number of pupils who
are staying at secondary modern schools beyond the normal
school-leaving age and in sixth-forms at grammar schools.
<head>AN ACHIEVEMENT</head>
   <p>It is interesting to note that in a period when the County is
faced with such large increases of primary and secondary school
pupils, it has been possible to complete the replacement of All-age
schools by new secondary schools, and to build new grammar schools, so
that appropriate secondary education is available throughout the
County for all pupils according to their age, ability and aptitude.
   <p>This in itself is a noteworthy achievement in a county with such
a wide variety of conditions &mdash; rural and urban, agricultural and
industrial, and residential.
   <p>Also it should be noted that as well as the building of new
grammar and secondary modern schools, good progress is being made with
the improvement of facilities in existing grammar and secondary modern
schools.
   <p>In further education, provision is being made for new and
improved technical colleges. Major extensions are now in course of
construction at the Carlett Park (Eastham), and Mid-Cheshire
(Hartford) Central Colleges of Further Education at a cost of
&pound;465,000 and &pound;300,000 respectively.
<head>EXTENSIONS</head>
   <p>Work is due to begin in February on a &pound;260,000 extension at
the North Cheshire College at Sale. Planning permission has just been
received for the building of a Technical College at Hyde, and the
estimated cost of this will be &pound;398,500, and a new College of Further
Education at Crewe costing &pound;600,000 is to be built by the Cheshire
Authority in 1961/62.
   <p>There is also a steady growth in the number of students at
universities and technical colleges. In the past five years there has
been an increase of nearly 20 per cent. in the number of students
attending Cheshire Technical Colleges, and this increase will continue
over the next five years as the new and enlarged colleges come to
completion.
   <p>It is interesting to note that, at the present time, the County
Education Committee is making grants to 1,565 university students and
it is anticipated that there will be approximately 50 additional
students receiving grants in 1961/62.
   <p>This is reflected in increased grants to students and increased
fees at colleges of further education outside Cheshire which some
County students attend. In total some 2,940 students are receiving
financial aid for their training in Universities, Teachers' Training
Colleges, Technical Colleges and Schools of Art and Music.
   <p>In conclusion it should be pointed out that, based on the net
rate and grant-borne expenditure per thousand population, Cheshire's
expenditure for all branches of education service (including primary,
secondary and special schools, further education, the training of
teachers, medical inspection and treatment, provision of milk and
meals, the transport of pupils and agricultural education) is &pound;12,893
as opposed to the average of all counties in England and Wales of
&pound;13,220.
<head>A-I THEME FOR ROYALTY PLAY</head>
   <p><quote>FORBIDDEN FLESH,</quote> the controversial play at the Royalty
Theatre next week, is by punch-packing author Eugene Hamilton. His
previous play, <quote>A Girl Called Sadie,</quote> packed the Royalty on visits
by two different touring companies.
   <p>His new play deals with the question of artificial insemination.
The author raises the query as to whether a father will feel the same
towards a child obtained by these means as to one normally conceived.
   <p>His leading character finds himself about to become a father to
two different children, one through artificial insemination. On the
one hand is the wife trying to tie him down to a secure suburban
marriage, and on the other is Eily, the wild Irish girl played with
flashing eyes and a tongue like a whip-lash by dark-haired Sarah
Travis, who is herself Irish.
   <p>Two points of interest to Cestrians. The play is set in
Liverpool, where it takes place in the Irish quarter. And when it was
first performed in Manchester, the Lord Mayor, who was invited to the
premiere, made national news headlines by refusing to allow his
18-years-old daughter to attend.
   <p>The play has since been banned in Eire because of its outspoken
nature, although it has done capacity business in all the principal
cities and towns of England, especially those with large Irish
populations. At Chester it will be presented for adults only.
<head>IT IS EASY TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONES'S IN SWEDEN'S THINGWALL</head>
<head><quote>NEWS and Advertiser</quote> reader Mr. H. Arnold, who received
his <quote>News and Advertiser</quote> <quote>Spirit of Wirral</quote> Calendar in
Karlstad, Sweden, has written this article.</head>
   <p>TURNING over the <quote>Spirit of Wirral</quote> calendar I see that
the February picture is of Thingwall whose Viking name was Tingralla.
It is snowbound. I am writing this from another place once named
Tingralla &mdash; there are others in Europe &mdash; which is also snowbound, but
here the comparison stops.
   <p>In 1584 King Charles the Ninth gave it a charter as a borough,
after which it changed its name to Karlstad (Charlestown). It became
the seat of a bishop. Like many other Swedish towns of wooden
buildings huddled together, it was burnt down.
   <p>It has since been re-planned with wide streets and boulevards,
and more fire-resisting buildings. It has important industries based
on the forests (timber, pulp and paper) and is a celebrated centre for
engineering.
<head>SEABORNE TRADE</head>
   <p>Excepting for about two months in each year commencing about
now it has a seaborne trade through Lake Varen and the Trollhattan
Canal. Ice put a stop to navigation last week, and traffic has to be
routed by rail or road to and from ice-free ports such as Gottenburg,
until the oncoming of spring.
   <p>Although there are papers in neighbouring towns not more than
forty miles away, Karlstad, with a population of 40,000, supports two
morning daily papers, one Conservative, the other Socialist.
   <p>They are by no means solely <squote>provincial</squote>. For example,
yesterday's Conservative paper discusses in its leading article the
effect of the Common Market on Swedish agriculture, mentioning several
times the views of Mr. Woolley, the Cheshire farmer who is now
chairman of the National Farmers' Union.
   <p>There is a good deal of interest in the advertising columns.
   <p>A fortnight ago there were many <squote>Acknowledgements</squote> under which
one-inch single column entries were inserted by individual postmen and
lorry drivers collecting milk for the creameries thanking publicly all
those who had given them Christmas boxes.
   <p>Dog taxes became due on January 1st. The amount is fixed by
local authorities and varies from place to place. Hereabouts the
standard seems to be the equal of 55s. per dog over three months
old. Official advertisements remind dog-owners that the charge will
be doubled if it is not met by January 31st.
   <p>Other authorities offer rewards for the extermination of pests &mdash;
27s. 6d. for a fox and 55s. for a mink. These animals are very
destructive to poultry. Escapees from fur farms, they find abundant
shelter in the forests.
<head>REFUSE IN BAGS</head>
   <p>There is no mystery about Council, health, water, fishery or
other authorities' proceedings. The agenda for forthcoming meetings
appear as paid advertisements.
   <p>Yesterday the Council of a small local town gave notice in a
six-inch column advertisement that household rubbish must in future be
put into paper bags before being put into the garbage bins. It
claimed that in summer this would reduce the stench of decaying matter
and in winter would lighten and speed up the work of dustmen as they
would not have to dig frozen refuse from inside the bins.
   <p>In more than one town the collected refuse is burnt under boilers
which supply hot water to houses, thus cutting out the need for
individual heating plants.
<head>TAX REGISTERS</head>
   <p>Folk interested in public affairs can learn a lot in Sweden.
They can even learn that newsagents and booksellers sell annuals
(called taxation registers) wherein everybody's assessable income
within the area of the authority is shown.
   <p>It may be difficult for people in Britain to know if they are
keeping up with the Jones's. In Sweden they have only to look into
the local taxation register to know whether or not they are keeping up
with the Svenssons (Swedish Jones's).
<head>From Dee to Dublin was so difficult</head>
   <p>ONE of the most interesting features of local history is the
way in which Wirral's Deeside villages came to be regarded over the
centuries, as the main ports for the Irish trade, not only locally,
but for England. The only rival was Holyhead, but many travellers
preferred the longer sea voyage to the difficult travel in reaching
the Anglesey port.
   <p>Except for the fact that Chester had been established at the head
of the estuary, and when the river silted the Wirral villages were
used as ports instead, it is probable that the estuary would never
have gained any commerce. As a haven, a place for ships to shelter,
the Dee shore of the peninsula was as an inhospitable place as it
could possibly be.
   <p>Shelter from westerly winds was virtually non-existent, but the
worst fault from a shipping point of view was that craft could sail
down the channel and so to the open sea only when the wind came from
the easterly quarter.

<text id=LOBB01>
<head>EDITORIAL</head>
<head>Dilemma of South Africa</head>
   <p>PRIME Minister after Prime Minister speaks out in revulsion
against the South African Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth Conference in London.
   <p>Will it end with South Africa's exclusion from the Commonwealth?
The issue is touch and go.
   <p>There is a possibility that it will not be settled at this
conference. It may be agreed to wait until South Africa actually
becomes a Republic later in the year.
   <p>But if a final decision is to be faced now, on which side do the
strongest arguments lie?
<head>A MISTAKE</head>
   <p>THE Archbishop of Capetown has shown that the matter is not
clear-cut. The Archbishop has long been a courageous fighter against
apartheid. He must be heard with attention.
   <p>On purely practical grounds he holds that it would be a mistake
to expel South Africa, weakening the whites who are working for a
change of policy. In his view it would also be against the interests
of the Africans.
   <p>He holds that more pressure can be put on South Africa while she
remains in the Commonwealth than could be exercised were she cut off
from it.
   <p>On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, including African
leaders, feel that nothing less than the shock of expulsion will
weaken the grip of Dr. Verwoerd and the Nationalists. They point
out that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning the apartheid
policy.
<head>WIDER PICTURE</head>
   <p>THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society. A policy of
racial discrimination in any of its countries is surely the one thing
that it could not survive.
   <p>Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in London,
millions at home would regard as fraudulent a Commonwealth which had
room for a racist South Africa. And this is a Commonwealth in which
five citizens are coloured for every one who is white.
   <p>Seen in this wider picture, a South Africa that clings to
apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a liability to the whole
Western world.
   <p>A practical solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft a set
of principles excluding race discrimination. And so leave South
Africa to make the grade, or go out.
<head>The Queen's return</head>
   <p>THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home tonight from
their tour in the East.
   <p>The duke's trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts have
taken the headlines in this country.
   <p>Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense success. The Queen
has won a triumph.
   <p>It would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal performances as
tiger and rhino hunts were dropped from future Royal programmes. But
the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by their visit. The
warmth of their welcome in India and Pakistan are happy memories.
<head>Becoming a better neighbour</head>
   <p>WEST GERMANY &mdash; followed yesterday by the Dutch &mdash; has made the
gesture of a good neighbour. She has put up the value of her money.
   <p>Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step in the
direction of live-and-let-live.
   <p>Hopes will now grow brighter of further international
co-operation, which is the only way to solve the payments difficulties
that upset the Western world.
   <p>Britain and the U.S., which have problems with their
balances, will gain some immediate help. What it means in practical
terms is that our exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper for
Germans to buy, while the goods which Germany exports will be made a
little dearer.
<head>UNPOPULAR</head>
   <p>BOOMING Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports as
a means to curb rising prices at home.
   <p>She is also aware how unpopular she has been growing by failing
until now to co-operate as a creditor nation should.
   <p>Germany exports much more than she imports. For upwards of five
years the world's reserves of dollars have been drained into Germany.
There they have stayed uselessly locked up because Germany has no
tradition of trading abroad.
   <p>In addition the strength of Germany's trading position has
attracted speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars,
hoping for the mark to rise, as has now happened.
<head>IS IT ENOUGH?</head>
   <p>WILL the new valuation be enough to correct Germany's massive
trading surplus and choke off speculation against dollar and pound?
That is doubtful.
   <p>If, however, in addition to her new good-neighbour gesture,
Germany takes a really big share in giving aid to underdeveloped
nations, the world outlook will be brighter.
   <p>What gives rise to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
other leading Western nations are at long last moving towards a
solution of currency problems by co-operation.
<head>An advertisement</head>
   <p>A CURIOUS advertisement appears on page nine, paid for by
that curious body Moral Re-Armament. Those who lend their names to
this kind of advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent of
politics, perhaps, or carried away by the idea that moral regeneration
would solve all our problems. So it would. While we are waiting for
the millenium, however, most of us would prefer to put our hopes for
earthly justice in instruments of democracy, such as trade unions and
our local and national Parliaments.
   <p>Should the Herald publish such advertisements? This is a
difficult question. It would obviously be wrong to refuse all
political advertisements with which we disagree. When an
advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful, or
where the total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers, it
is right to exercise editorial discretion. The MRA advertisement
falls into neither category, though many readers will dislike it. We
publish it in the belief that the alert readers of the Herald will
not be beguiled by this kind of soft-soap.
<head>The hard way of peace</head>
   <p>THE authority of the United Nations has suffered grave injury
in the Congo. It must be restored.
   <p>A United Nations force composed of 135 Sudanese has been disarmed
and expelled from the supply port of Matadi, after being heavily
attacked by a much stronger force of Colonel Mobutu's Congolese
troops.
   <p>The first reaction of the Sudanese Government was to denounce the
United Nations for <quote>negligence and impotence,</quote> and to say that its
400 troops in the Congo would be taken home.
   <p>The reaction can be understood. The Sudan's concern for its men
is natural. But this could hardly be a dignified exit.
<head>WRONG TARGET</head>
   <p>IF the UN is blamed for being weak, it would be more
logical to send in more men, not weaken it further by desertion.
   <p>It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr. Hammarskjold and the
UN's servants. The responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
which have undertaken the task of preserving peace in the Congo. That
is not a ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every right to blame
the politicians unless they see it through.
   <p>When the United Nations instructed Mr. Hammarskjold to use
force if necessary to prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
would arise unless it gave him the physical power to comply with the
policy. That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold made.
   <p>India has responded handsomely by providing 3,000 men, who must
take about a fortnight to arrive. If the UN forces were thick
enough on the ground, such incidents as that at Matadi would not
happen.
<head>U.S. SHIPS</head>
   <p>THE UN's ability to keep peace depends simply on
adequate support by the nations which have set their hands to this
plough.
   <p>The big Powers involved in the Cold War must of course keep out.
The Americans were justified in diverting naval ships in case
non-combatant help was wanted; but they stressed that there was no
intention to intervene in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
again, satisfied that they were not required.
   <p>It is to be hoped that the UN will be re-established in
their port by negotiation and that there will be no more outrages.
But back, Mr. Hammarskjold is determined, they must go.
   <p>The best news for the Congo would be agreement between its rival
political leaders. Through the patient efforts of UN
conciliators they are meeting for the first time, in Malagasy
(formerly Madagascar).
<head>ONLY SAFEGUARD</head>
   <p>THE world will sigh with relief when this strife-torn land
gets itself a government which all outsiders can recognise.
   <p>Nobody will want to police the Congo when the Congo itself can do
the job. All the UN contingents will be glad to go home.
   <p>Meanwhile every statesman in Africa must realise that there must
be far worse consequences if the UN had to abandon its task.
Small nations would not remain free for long in this world if the
UN was not their bulwark.
<head>The smile on the face of Verwoerd</head>
   <p>THE British public has now had the chance to take a
close-up look at Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, Prime Minister of South
Africa, the foremost apostle of the pernicious doctrine of <quote>racial
purity.</quote>
   <p>He has made a strong impression. But not, perhaps, quite the
impression that he intended.
   <p>For most people the sight of that bland, unctuous, impregnably
righteous face, wreathed in smiles, has been enough to make their
blood run cold.
   <p>Some misguided people might have a sneaking sympathy for a man
who defends a racial policy on supposedly practical grounds. At least
it would be possible to argue with him rationally.
   <p>But a man who believes, like Dr. Verwoerd, that a basically
evil policy is good, that it has the sanction of religion and is a
bulwark of Christianity, is beyond the reach of reason.
<head>COCOONED</head>
   <p>ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he
regards as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as <quote>a
policy of good neighbourliness.</quote>
   <p>We may be sure that he is not being hypocritical. That is what
he really believes.
   <p>A good neighbour to those Africans who, under apartheid, will be
forced back to their tribal reserves with no prospect but a cramped
and primitive existence.
   <p>A good neighbour to those Africans who will continue to live as
hewers of wood and drawers of water in the white areas of South
Africa, without rights and without hope.
<head>NIGHTMARE</head>
   <p>THE same sort of good neighbour that he proved to be to the
Jews fleeing from Hitler in the thirties. It was Dr. Verwoerd who
led a protest against admitting any of them because they would
<quote>defile</quote> the national white stock.
   <p>It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Verwoerd in his
nightmare world. It is this that makes illusory any hopes that he may
be influenced to change course.
   <p>The Archbishop of Capetown, Dr. Joost \de Blank, has pleaded
that South Africa should be allowed to stay in the Commonwealth.
Otherwise, he says, those inside the country who still oppose
apartheid will be left even more isolated and alone.
   <p>The views of the Archbishop, who has maintained an unflinching
witness to what Christianity really means, must carry weight.
   <p>But what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries do to
bring support and comfort to this gallant minority?
<head>EXPULSION?</head>
   <p>THERE is no evidence that the policy of appeasement has
modified the actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary, apartheid
is being applied ever more ruthlessly.
   <p>The shock of expulsion from the Commonwealth now seems to be the
only way left to try to bring home to the people of South Africa that
Dr. Verwoerd is leading them to disaster.
   <p>It may be that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers will decide
against this final step.
   <p>If that is their decision they should also go unequivocally on
record that they regard apartheid as evil and indefensible.
   <p>Unless they do at least that, Dr. Verwoerd will be able to
return home claiming a triumph. His smile will be blander than ever.
<head>The old routine</head>
   <p>WE are in for it again: another Royal Wedding. Between now
and June, when the Duke of Kent will marry Miss Worsley, hardly a day
will pass without a story or a picture or probably both, about the
nuptial arrangements.
   <p>Men readers may grow more than a little weary of it all. So may
a few emancipated women who pride themselves on their commonsense.

<text id=LOBB02>
<head>Time to start talking</head>
   <p>One of the grim oddities of the Berlin crisis is that everyone
is in favour of talking but nobody seems to know how to start. The
State Department keeps approving of <quote>meaningful negotiations</quote> and
so even does President \de Gaulle, though his notion of what makes
talks useful or timely is a lot more restrictive than other people's.
In the intervals of bandying about threats of annihilation Mr
Khrushchev too sees <quote>a glimmer of hope</quote> for talks, preferably on
terms that would give him right from the start everything he wants.
Yet hardly anything is done to bring talks nearer. On the Western
side the chief obstacles, apart from the stiffening of the diplomatic
joints which afflicts everybody, have been two: the West German
election campaign and the objections of France. When the Western
Foreign Ministers meet in Washington tomorrow the first of these will
be nearly out of the way. It will be time for the Ministers to get
down in earnest to the business of working out a common approach to
Russia on Germany and Berlin.
   <p>The means of setting talks going are clear enough provided that
the Soviet Government wishes to talk at all. The session of the
United Nations Assembly which opens on Tuesday should anyhow bring
together the Foreign Ministers of Britain, the United States, and
Russia. The French Government largely ignores the <quote>tumultuous and
scandalous</quote> Assembly. But that might give President \de Gaulle a
convenient excuse for keeping out of talks if he still thought this
was not the time to start them. What seems certain is that those who
advocate putting off any approach until Mr Krushchev gives evidence
of a change of heart (whatever that may mean) would have us run risks
greater than the West ought to run &mdash; and greater than President
Kennedy's most influential advisers seem disposed to face. The real
question is what we should put to the Soviet Government as a basis for
talks: and that means working out what we know to be the essential
interests of the West in Berlin and what we suppose that the Soviet
Government may now be after.
   <p>The West needs to make it absolutely clear that the freedom of
West Berlin and free access to it are vital interests not to be
retreated from in the present state of Europe. Yet the question
remains, as before: is the Soviet Government interested chiefly in
sealing off East Germany and securing some kind of general recognition
for it? Or is it determined to do away with the freedom of West
Berlin and free access to it (on the excuse of keeping out
<quote>revanchists</quote> and so on) at almost any risk? If the first, the
signs now are that Britain and the United States at all events might
well exchange some kind of recognition for an up to date guarantee of
access, perhaps to be supervised by a commission of the four powers
and the two Germanies, and that West Germany might well fall in with
this, however reluctantly. (Mr Diefenbaker's proposal of United
Nations supervision has the drawback that, like other proposed ways of
bringing in the United Nations, it would presumably mean admitting
both Germanies to the organisation &mdash; and that would be a lot for a lot
of people to swallow all at once). If, however, the Soviet Government
seems determined to swallow up West Berlin then there is little for
the West to do except stand firm.
   <p>This is where many people see with horror the prospect of a
nuclear war: if everyone stands firm, they ask, will not the next step
be a clash leading inexorably to mutual annihilation? After looking
upon such a prospect Bertrand Russell has chosen to take the way of
civil disobedience and go to prison. All honour to him for acting
once again on his beliefs whatever the consequences. But those who
differ with his analysis are not necessarily less concerned at the
dreadful risks we all run. Nor need they be less concerned than Mr
Victor Gollancz, who in a letter on this page proposes that Mr
Macmillan should proclaim his readiness to negotiate <quote>naked</quote> and
unconditionally for the sake of saving the world. Why this should
move our allies or Mr Khrushchev &mdash; or indeed what it would mean &mdash; is
not clear. The choice lies not between nuclear war and Soviet
domination; it lies between the constant risk that attends the
exchanges of human beings formidably armed and the perilous
self-dissolution of the West that would come of a surrender of West
Berlin. On this reading what Mr Gollancz calls manoeuvring, and
what we should call cool-headed and inventive negotiation, is a means
not to destruction but to safety.
<head>Second revise</head>
   <p>The Government's pompous little statement on Northern Rhodesia
does not say much, but it says what is necessary &mdash; that the Northern
Rhodesia Constitution is open to revision. This is news, however much
the Government tries to disguise it by saying that the revision would
be <quote>in accordance with normal practice.</quote> The formula which has
caused all the trouble is itself a revision, brought about in
deference to Sir Roy Welensky, of proposals which the Colonial
Secretary tabled in February; <quote>reasonable representations,</quote> which
the Government now invites, have been made against it for many weeks.
The Government is now saying that consideration of these reasonable
representations is being delayed by the outbreak of violence. In
fact, the cart and the horse are the other way round: the violence
broke out because the reasonable representations went unheeded.
   <p>The request which all interested parties (except the United
Federal) have made is that the Legislative Council elected under Mr
Macleod's system of three blocks of seats shall contain a
representative majority. Formula One, which appeared in February,
appeared to make this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June,
made it very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity that
the Government should ever have been led away from this principle. It
is a great pity that the Government should give the appearance of
responding, not to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
the violence which he tried to prevent.
<head>Programme for Katanga</head>
   <p>The United Nations had already had a bad press before reports
were received yesterday of alleged indiscipline by some of its troops
in Elisabethville. A full account of these incidents will no doubt be
demanded by the General Assembly next week.
   <p>The general feeling is that if the United Nations wanted to clean
up the Congo it could have started with stables more Augean than M.
Tshombe's. But Katanga has for so long been represented &mdash; not
altogether falsely &mdash; as a secure and industrious little state beset by
wild and envious politicians that its less agreeable side has been
overlooked. It can equally be seen as an alliance between M.
Tshombe and the Union Miniere (which has a substantial British
shareholding) to apply the huge copper revenues properly belonging to
the whole Congo for the unbalanced development of only a part of it.
A long time will be needed, of course, to bridge the gap between the
admirable industrial welfare services provided for copper employees
and the general lot of rural Congolese. This will be true however the
money is shared. But the disproportion between Katanga's
happy-go-lucky expansion and the perpetual Budget deficits of the
Congolese Central Government has for too long been an obstacle to the
rebuilding of the Congo.
   <p>It is odd that the very people who apply this argument to the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and who blanch at the thought of
losing Northern Rhodesia's copper revenues, should not see that it
applies even more forcibly to the Congo, where there is little light
industry and no European agriculture (apart from the plantations) to
bolster up the rest of the economy. The explanation may be that in
neither case is the argument disinterested. M. Tshombe has once or
twice been brought to see the discrepancy, and has even talked of
sharing his revenues. But he has never signed the cheque.
   <p>Independent Katanga has never, in truth, looked like a permanent
proposition, which is why no country has recognised it, and why most
of the Europeans serving in its forces have been ne'er-do-wells. The
jolt had to come; and unfortunately it does not seem to have come as
cheaply as at first appeared. Dr O'Brien may have taken one of the
tides in the affairs of men; omitted, Katanga might have straggled on
to a worse tragedy.
   <p>It remains to consolidate the reunion of Katanga with the Congo,
and for this purpose the Central Government is sending a commissioner
formerly associated with M. Gizenga's Stanleyville regime. The
development may sound more sinister than it is. M. Gizenga has
notably failed to make capital out of his succession to Lumumba: it is
too early to say that he is not a Marxist at all, but if he is he
comes from a peculiarly Congolese strain. The Russians seem to have
no time for him. Thus his accomplice now sent to Elisabethville may
be no more than a personification of the Central Government's new
authority. But this is not the way for the Congo-Katanga dispute to
be ended.
   <p>The key to a solution surely lies in the continued recognition by
the United Nations of M. Tshombe as President of Katanga Province.
If he has taken flight he should be invited to return to head the
provincial Government. An attempt has already been made to organise
the Congolese States into a confederation. Now that President Tshombe
has been shown that independence is not allowed he should strive for
as much provincial autonomy as the other States will give him. He
should not despair of keeping a large part of his copper revenue.
Dr O'Brien has praised the valour of Katanga soldiers. M.
Tshombe should not encourage them to drive the point home. Instead of
putting up a desperate resistance he should spend an hour reading the
Nigerian Constitution.
<head>The first step</head>
   <p>It is encouraging news that Mr Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign
Minister, will meet Mr Dean Rusk in New York next week for a talk
about German problems. The Soviet Government has lost no time in
taking up President Kennedy's suggestion, made on Wednesday, that such
a meeting should be arranged while Mr Gromyko is over for the United
Nations General Assembly.
   <p>No one supposes that Mr Gromyko and Mr Rusk will settle the
problems of Berlin and the two Germanys on their own. But, as Mr
Modibo Keita said after his talk with Mr Kennedy on Wednesday, a
Summit meeting must be prepared at a lower diplomatic level. This is
the necessary first step. And indeed it is the first time since the
crisis began that any specific arrangement for serious discussion
between the two sides has been made. There have been plenty of
general declarations about willingness to meet and talk, but
conspicuously no mention of time and place. To be able to say <quote>New
York next week</quote> is an important advance. We must not be
overconfident that this meeting will lead on to further and decisive
ones; but without it, we could not look for them.
<head>Getting it over</head>
   <p>Federal Germany votes tomorrow and not a day too soon. There
can seldom have been an election campaign which more people in and out
of the country wanted to see over and done with. To Germany's Western
allies the campaign has been a millstone weighing down and almost
paralysing their efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with the
Berlin crisis. It need not have been such a burden if Western
Governments had not been convinced that they must do nothing to harm
even remotely Dr Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor.
But they were so convinced and they have had to take the
consequences. Meanwhile in Germany itself the course of the campaign
has dismayed a good many people: they too will be glad when the
polling stations close.

<head>ACROSS BARRIERS</head>
   <p>The third assembly of the World Council of Churches in Delhi
has added substance to the aspiration of its title. The entry of the
Russian Orthodox Church and its sisters in Bulgaria, Poland, and
Rumania has had two stimulating effects. Some east European churches
had been members already, and one major meeting was held in Hungary in
1956, but only now is the Christian witness in communist countries
strongly represented. Although the Roman Catholics are no more than
observers, the charge of pan-protestantism loses its validity. The
other Orthodox churches and the Old Catholics in the council are no
longer a few among the many that come from the world of the
Reformation. At the same time the evangelical complexion of the
council grows stronger through the integration with the International
Missionary Council and the admission of growing communions in South
America and newly independent churches in Africa. There are now twice
as many churches from these continents and from Asia as there were at
the first assembly in Amsterdam in 1948. The approach to universality
is gratifying. It has its complications.
   <p>Many of the churches which came together at Amsterdam thirteen
years ago had long cooperated in the two movements &mdash; Faith and Order
and Life and Work &mdash; whose confluence formed the council. Cooperation
since then has steadily grown. The entry this year of so many
churches unaccustomed to these ecumenical encounters may hold up the
movement towards closer cooperation for a time. There will have to be
wider geographical representation on the central committee and other
continuing bodies and this may be at the cost of some efficiency.
Unanimity will come less easily. The Anglican and main Protestant
communions readily agree on many questions, such as birth control and
the population explosion, which the presence in strength of the
Orthodox churches makes more contentious. On the other hand, there
has been a striking agreement on the delicate matter of defining the
actual theological basis of the council itself.
   <p>Such a body cannot address itself successfully to many of the
immediate temporal issues. It should seek and share guidance not on
what is to be done in such and such a special field but on the
criteria by which the Christian should be guided. The declaration on
racialism could reasonably be unequivocal, although it has cost the
allegiance of the Dutch churches in South Africa. But discussion on
current points of east-west conflict could not go much farther than,
for example, the truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
cannot be followed together. What the council has done &mdash; and it is an
achievement &mdash; is to make religious contact across the greatest
political barrier in what is not yet a unitary world. In the words of
one Russian delegate, older churches like his own have personally
discovered younger churches for the first time.
   <p>The theme of facing together the broader tasks that can be
tackled only together ran through speech after speech. It is worth
recalling the prophetic words in 1938 of DR. J. H. OLDHAM,
elected honorary president at Delhi: &mdash;
<quote>
   <p>Study must be undertaken by the churches in common, for the new
forces are world forces; they will sooner or later affect the life of
every church, and it is therefore essential that on this point the
churches should learn from each other and share with each other
whatever light God has given them in their attempt to face new and
unprecedented situations.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>The shifting weight from western to eastern communities
emphasizes the challenge to the receptivity of individual churches.
The effect of the assembly will depend on the willingness of parishes
and congregations to respond to the call to fresh service, and to
assimilate into their daily witness the common thought of the member
churches.
   <p>One of the duties of the assembly is to set the standards for
continuing common study and action. Since the last assembly help for
refugees of every faith has been extended to cover more of the world
and different needs. It is now perhaps the best known ecumenical
activity. Here again, however, the new and enlarged council speaks
with different voices and stresses. In the Russian Orthodox Church
the council has incorporated a community with a distinctive tradition
of Christian witness, emphasizing devotion and not social work. In
abstaining from voting on the resolution which extended the definition
of religious liberty to political opinions the Russians in Delhi
followed a tradition far older than 1917. Their position is close to
the statement at Evanston in 1954 by PROFESSOR HROMADKA, of
Prague, who is an evangelical: &mdash;
<quote>
   <p>The Church marches through our secular world avoiding and
rejecting identification with any human absolute and rejecting also
any efforts to look for an absolute evil in any secular institution or
in any man. We must not apply human, civil, or political categories
of freedom to the church.
<QUOTE/>
   <p>Some problems of such a world meeting remain unresolved. A
thousand delegates are too many for corporate thinking, but corporate
thinking there must be if all member churches are to have an effective
voice in deciding future lines of cooperation. The aspiration of
visible as opposed to merely <quote>spiritual</quote> unity was endorsed at
Delhi; but it is doubtful if it was greatly advanced &mdash; or, indeed,
could be so at so comprehensive an assembly.
<head>A Man of Peace</head>
   <p>Although he is no longer a titular chief ALBERT LUTHULI is
in the truest sense of the word a leader of his people in South
Africa. His arrival with his wife in Britain on a flying visit before
he goes on to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo will give British
people a chance that they gladly take of expressing their admiration
for his courage, sincerity, and restraint. It is ironical that he
should reach Europe only a few days before the Republic of South
Africa will be celebrating the annual holiday which in origin
commemorates the victory of the Voortrekkers over the Zulu Impis at
Blood River.
   <p>MR. LUTHULI, who belongs to that proud and warlike people,
is one of those Africans who have buried the hatchet. He has always
shown himself ready &mdash; and no one who knows him can doubt his
sincerity &mdash; to lead the Zulus and others down the paths of peace.
Coexistence with their white neighbours on terms of mutual
self-respect has been his ideal. A forward looking Government would
have understood the significance of this powerful encouragement to
moderation and would have taken MR. LUTHULI into its counsels.
Unfortunately it is looking backwards that has prevailed. Those who
put MR. LUTHULI into prison and then placed indefensible
restrictions on his rights as a man have never forgotten Blood River.
They live in a perpetual state of mental laager. They can see
MR. LUTHULI only over the sights of their rifles.
   <p>Even the permission given to leave the native land which is half
a gaol for him is grudging and qualified. The MINISTER of the
INTERIOR emphasized, when his passport was granted, that in the
opinion of the South African Government MR. LUTHULI did not
measure up to the international standard laid down for the award of
the Nobel Peace Prize. The South African Government is the last
quarter to which any reasonable man would refer on such an issue. The
decision of the Swedish judges has rightly been applauded in all
countries that believe in freedom and scorn racial injustice. MR.
LUTHULI cannot speak freely to us. But he must draw encouragement
from the reception that he will receive here and elsewhere on his
journey. <quote>Who will deny</quote>, he has said sadly, <quote>that thirty years
of my life have been spent in knocking in vain at a closed and barred
door?</quote> Alas, no one can deny it. But that is all the more reason
for saluting a veteran fighter for peace.
<head>Hire-Purchase</head>
   <p>With the first and fundamental clause of MR. W. T.
WILLIAMS'S Hire-Purchase Bill general agreement can be expected. An
increasingly important weakness of the existing legislation (the 1938
Act as amended in 1954) is that, apart from livestock, it governs only
agreements involving goods worth &pound;300 or less. As the Conservative
Political Centre report on consumer protection recently pointed out,
both inflation and affluence have made it reasonable to raise the
limits for all agreements to &pound;1,000 &mdash; the level already established
for livestock. MR. WILLIAMS sets out to achieve this. The
existing limits have long been out of date, especially since the
growth of car hire-purchase, and most citizens' advice bureaux could
probably produce cases illustrating the difficulties and abuses which
have arisen as a result.
   <p>The efforts of MR. WILLIAMS to make the terms of agreements
even clearer to the customer are also to be commended. The
notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
agreement is signed. To this there will be some opposition. The Bill
is short and modest in scope, and it is doubtful whether the other
Private Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps. This
fact may give the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience
until the next report from the Molony committee. Comprehensive
legislation is obviously preferable. They should not, however,
disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of parliamentary
opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run.
<head>By Degrees</head>
   <p>Centigrade v. Fahrenheit. The fight is on. The challenger
has behind it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE
for AIR but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the
Meteorological Office. The press and the broadcasting authorities are
asked to help. To begin with, both temperatures will be put in the
ring together. SIR GRAHAM SUTTON, however, made no bones about it
yesterday. The purpose is to give fahrenheit the knock out. The
backers of centigrade would have got off to a better start if they had
taken more pains to explain the advantages to the general public of
the change. It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is at the
moment <quote>an awful mess up</quote> in the measurement of temperatures.
This, however, seems a matter of the convenience of specialists. The
ordinary British man and woman is conscious of no difficulty. Rather
than fifty million people having to be put out for the sake of 50,000
is there any reason why the centigrade countries should not change to
fahrenheit? Can it be shown that the one scale is demonstrably better
than the other?
   <p>The centigraders may be in for a stiffer fight than they think.
They may have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market.
Even then it might be easier to persuade the British public to go
over to decimal coinage &mdash; in certain circumstances the time would come
when this would suit their convenience &mdash; rather than to change their
system of recording temperatures. In any case, fahrenheit need not
lose heart. Once before, and that not so long ago, the authorities
ganged up to alter the habits of the people. That effort was to
enforce the adoption of the twenty-four hour clock. Then, also, the
B.B.C. were roped in. The only result was that the
well-meaning corporation became very unpopular. So much so that the
new system, which was inaugurated in April, 1934, was thrown out in
August of the same year. It is generally a sign that Governments are
balked in the big things when they cannot leave the little, familiar
ways of life alone.
<head>Summons to the Unknown</head>
   <p>One of the little trials that a man must learn to bear when he
admits the telephone to his home is that, when he hurries to its side
to answer a call, it will sometimes stop ringing before he gets there.
He is dividing the dahlias at the bottom of the garden, or hanging a
critical bit of wallpaper in the spare bedroom, or delicately
adjusting the car in the garage, or listening absorbed to a concert on
the wireless when the persisting summons penetrates to his dream
world.

<head>OPINION</head>
<head>SPEAK UP FOR OUR FRIENDS!</head>
   <p>A BAFFLED and bewildered little country stands at the
centre of an international storm. Belgium is accused &mdash; without a
scrap of evidence &mdash; of being implicated in the murder of Patrice
Lumumba.
   <p>Her leaders are insulted, her embassies are attacked in a score
of countries.
   <p>In Ghana, President Nkrumah, who has done more than most to stir
up trouble in the Congo, orders every Belgian citizen to quit his
country.
<head>Boldly and clearly</head>
   <p>HOUNDING Belgium has become an international pastime. Why?
Because those who said the Congolese could govern themselves will not
admit they were wrong. So Belgium, bowed down by internal troubles,
mourning a terrible air crash, is made their scapegoat.
   <p>Who will speak up for Belgium? Who else but Britain. We have
fought beside Belgium in two world wars. We are allies still.
   <p>Britain should champion Belgium. Not with the careful, hooded
language of diplomacy, but boldly and fearlessly.
   <p>It is time to show the world that this country does not desert
her friends.
<head>THE FULL TABLE</head>
   <p>HAPPY, happy families! Never before have Britain's larders
been so well stocked. Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
substantially higher last year than in 1959.
   <p>Lucky, lucky housewives! To have such a splendid variety of
goods to choose from.
   <p>Not so long ago older folk were reminding young wives, harassed
by shortages, of the good old days of abundance. Now it is mother who
picks up recipes from her daughter.
   <p>The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in Britain
today!
<head>GO AHEAD</head>
   <p><quote>THIS is colour day,</quote> proclaimed the American television
network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its programmes
in bright colours.
   <p>In America colour TV is five years old. There are already
600,000 sets in use.
   <p>What about Britain? The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour
TV service, but the commercial TV contractors want to delay
it for 10 years.
   <p>The Government should settle this argument with two words to the
B.B.C.: &mdash;
   <p>Go ahead!
<head>MAN OF SYMPATHY</head>
   <p>ONE man beyond all others is saddened by the deaths of two
elderly sisters who killed themselves because they had to leave their
cottage.
   <p>Mr. John Crabb, clerk to Newmarket urban council, says: <quote>I
shall always feel this as a personal failure.</quote>
   <p>There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself.
The sisters had to quit as their home was falling down. And Mr.
Crabb did his best for them, even driving them to a new house.
   <p>John Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding. Too
often lacking in officialdom.

   <p>MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton does not want his daughter to

   <p>The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a Scot. The Lord
Chancellor is a Scot. The Prime Minister is a Scot &mdash; and so were four
of his predecessors this century.
   <p>Let Mr. Newton beware. By protesting against Scotland he may
be guilty of rebellion!
<head>THE EMPIRE IS PUT ON TRIAL</head>
   <p>ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial.
   <p>His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for five
years.
   <p>During this period Britain will be expected to subsidise and
defend the Cypriots. They will enjoy all the trading benefits of
Imperial Preference.
   <p>It is a safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
company will sign on again. It is equally certain that the British
Government will welcome them.
   <p>How splendid it would be if, just for once, the Government were
to voice the real feelings of the British people.
   <p>And tell Makarios they are not prepared to accept him on such
terms.
<head>OPTIMISTS WIN</head>
   <p>GOOD cheer for the week-end. Ford Motors are to put 13,000
men back on a five-day week. One more demonstration of the industry's
recovery.
   <p>As springtime approaches, orders pick up. And the car men get
ready for another bustling season.
   <p>The pessimists said the motor industry was on its knees. The

   <p>As usual, the optimists have been proved right.
<head>OUT AND ABOUT</head>
   <p>EARL RUSSELL and his friends have hit on an original way of
spending this afternoon. They intend to sit outside the Ministry of
Defence.
   <p>It is their protest against the H-bomb.
   <p>They ought to have a pleasant time. The weather forecast is
good; except for them, Whitehall should be deserted. And they will
have a fine view of St. James's Park, with its placid lake,
pelicans, rare ducks, and other wild life.
   <p>Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today? Head for the parks to
enjoy the sun. Not in a foolish cause, but in a glorious one.
   <p>Good health!
<head>THE TOILERS</head>
   <p>THIS group of men, says a report, work on average between
55 and 60 hours a week. They also put in an extra two or three
evenings. And they never go on strike.
   <p>Who are they? The trade union officials of Britain. Men who
earn only a fraction of what their talents and responsibilities could
bring in the open labour market.
   <p>The unions are fortunate indeed to find dedicated leaders at
cut-rate prices. But it is time the members decided to pay up and be
good employers.
<head>WRONG TARGET</head>
   <p>THE Labour Party says that the Tory Government is
destroying the social services.
   <p>Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the national income
was spent on social services. The present figure is 19.5 per cent.
   <p>There are many worthwhile targets for the Opposition. What a
pity to aim at the wrong one!
<head>HOW MANY SERFS?</head>
   <p>MRS. MARCIA POWER, whose husband made her clean his
uniform, wins a divorce. The judge says she had to act almost as a
serf.
   <p>Up and down the country husbands will be saying they would never
behave like that.
   <p>But do they ever ponder how their gardening tools are
mysteriously returned to the shed; their books tidied; and often, even
their shoes cleaned?
   <p>How wonderful if they showed their appreciation this morning with
a surprise box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers!
<head>THIS IS THE PRICE OF HASTE</head>
   <p>HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly in
Rhodesia!
   <p>Eighteen months ago this territory was peaceful, orderly, and
thriving. Africans within the Federal Government were getting
valuable experience in administration. Then Mr. Iain Macleod became
Colonial Secretary.
   <p>Suddenly everything changed. Timetables were scrapped. The
ill-conceived Monckton Commission was rushed out to Rhodesia.
   <p>Overnight, minor African politicians were inflated into
international figures. And as the British Government stepped up the
pace of change, so the Africans stepped up their demands.
<head>No choice</head>
   <p>TODAY, in London, that rash and thoughtless policy has caused
a crisis &mdash; a crisis that never should have happened.
   <p>No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching.
   <p>If the Government now reverses its plan to give the Africans
control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face difficulties from
African politicians greedy for power.
   <p>But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well be plunged
into chaos, like the Congo.
   <p>For Mr. Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice. They
must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos. And try to repair the damage
they have done.
<head>PROSPERITY LEAGUE</head>
   <p>WHO can grow the fastest? That is the exciting competition
going on among Britain's major industries.
   <p>Top of the table, at the moment, is the chemical industry. Then
comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
   <p>Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the tremendous
upsurge in investment. It reports that new factory building this year
is likely to be 40 per cent up on 1960.
   <p>Britain's business men are right to back their faith with cash.
For expansion today means still greater prosperity tomorrow.
<head>THEIR FREEDOM</head>
   <p>BERTRAND RUSSELL, the 88-year-old standard bearer of the
Ban-the-Bomb crusade, has a devoted following. Thousands march with
him &mdash; and sit with him too.
   <p>It is said by some that he is a saint; by others that he is a
prophet.
   <p>He is, in fact, a philosopher with a highly developed sense of
publicity who has been spectacularly wrong on the great issues of our
time.
<head>How long?</head>
   <p>BEFORE the war he urged the British people to welcome
Hitler's troops as tourists. After the war he favoured a preventive
war against Russia. Now he wants Britain to demolish her defences.
   <p>Throughout the years Lord Russell and his supporters have been
able to pursue their eccentric campaigns in freedom.
   <p>They should ask themselves this question: How long would that
freedom last if their policies were adopted?
<head>GOOD WILL MAN</head>

   <p>Some may ask: Is Welensky justified in being so harsh to those
who disagree with him?
   <p>The facts answer that.
<head>Congo shambles</head>
   <p>CONTRAST his firm, successful rule in Rhodesia with what has
happened in the Congo.
   <p>There Welensky's opponents have carried their theories into
practice. There a UNO army of Africans, bossed by an Indian, has
been in charge for months.
   <p>And what has it made of the Congo? A bloodstained shambles.
   <p>No wonder Welensky has lost all patience with his misguided
tormentors.
   <p>They have earned his strictures. And his contempt.
<head>THE THRIFTY ONES</head>
   <p>SOME people are for ever complaining that teenagers earn
too much and spend it all when they get it. Now a survey of the Post
Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that idea is.
   <p>The biggest group of depositors in the bank is made up of boys
and girls aged 15 to 19.
   <p>Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before. Certainly they
spend more.
   <p>But how splendid that in the most prosperous days in this
country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift should still have
a powerful appeal for young people.
<head>UNDERSTOOD!</head>
   <p>THE Danes are annoyed with British farmers for fighting
against Danish competition.
   <p>They say that our farmers do not seem to understand the meaning
of free trade. There is no doubt what the Danes understand by free
trade.
   <p>It is that they should be free to sell as much as they like here,
while buying more and more from our rivals. Germany has now
supplanted Britain as Denmark's principal supplier.
   <p>The farmers of Britain understand free trade. That is why they
fight it.
<head>CURTAIN UP</head>
   <p>THE Palace cinema at Buckley, near Chester, will be
reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric Platt, both aged 19.
   <p>Eric says: <quote>We believe in the cinema. And we know what people
want.</quote>
   <p>The combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation of public
taste has launched many great enterprises.
   <p>Barry and Eric have enthusiasm. They are backed by a resurgent
film industry. It could be curtain up on two success stories. Of the
old Palace. And Barry and Eric.
<head>FOLLOW OXFORD!</head>
   <p>DONS at Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
an honours degree course.
   <p>Farming is Britain's most vital industry. It is increasingly
dependent on new techniques &mdash; and on the universities to provide men
of knowledge and skill.
   <p>The older universities are often accused of being interested only
in dead subjects.
   <p>Now Cambridge has the opportunity to show it is just as
interested in the living. Particularly as its rival, Oxford, has had
a similar course in farming for 15 years!
<head>HERE ARE THE NEW PIONEERS</head>
   <p>JOHN GLENN, Virgil Grissom, Alan Shepard. One of these
three men has a date with destiny &mdash; the first journey into Space.
   <p>At the beginning of this wonderful century many people believed
that there were no more worlds to conquer.

<head>A STRANGE PEOPLE</head>
   <p>AT this time of the year Americans from Kansas, Seattle,
Scranton, Fresno, and another ten thousand pin-points (you try telling
a native of Kansas that his home-town is a pin-point!) all over the
United States, arrive in our islands.
   <p>The British Travel Association, which does excellent work in
taking care of all foreigners who want to have a good time here and
study what is pompously called <quote>The British Way of Life,</quote> have a
hard time on their hands.
   <p>From American sources I have just heard of two examples of The
British Host at Work.
   <p>One: A citizen of the U.S. was last week walking down
Oxford-street when he was seized by a total stranger who said somewhat
incoherently: <quote>You're an American, eh?</quote>
   <p>He pleaded guilty.
<head><squote>I Hate You</squote></head>
   <p><quote>I'm an Englishman &mdash; see? And I hate you Yanks &mdash; see?</quote>
   <p>Our transatlantic friend mildly replied: <quote>That's just too
bad.</squote>
   <p>Pause while the visitor correctly adjudicates that his accoster
is well loaded &mdash; or drunk.
   <p>The assailant then resumes: <quote>But if there's anything I can do
for you, anywhere you want to go, or you feel that somebody is trying
to put it across you, just you let me know and I'll be right here.
Nobody's going to shove ole Uncle Sam around!</quote>
   <p>He then took out a piece of paper, wrote his address on it and
added: <quote>Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me first.
I won't stand for it.</quote>
   <p>Exit a puzzled American.
   <p>
   <p>The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg to
Paris.
   <p>Two Americans on a visit to Europe &mdash; it was at least their
twentieth trip &mdash; fell into conversation with a shy, diffident
Englishman who they had seen on the Queen Mary.
   <p>They renewed mild pleasantries and, after some international
chit-chat, they told him that they were going to end their
explorations of the Old World by touring England.
   <p>They had in mind a kind of reviving postscript to the
eccentricities of the Continent to be concluded in the sage,
philosophical calm of the Anglo-Saxon world.
   <p>The Englishman in the train said: <quote>Mind if I give you just one
tiny point of advice?
   <p><quote>All our chaps will be absolutely delighted to see you BUT IF
YOU ARE IN A PUB FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T RAISE YOUR VOICE!</quote>
   <p>
   <p>The travellers from the New World who had been in Britain many
times before, were slightly stunned.
   <p>Afterwards they said: <quote>We thought we knew it all, but you
Britishers never run out of unturned stones.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent
darndest, I offer these sad complexities.
<head>The Ant Society</head>
   <p>IN the 1830's the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms
and many a good trade unionist since then has, in the hope of
improving the lot of his fellow workers, taken the theoretical Luddite
hammer again.
   <p>Hence the hostility to automation and the stop-watch
manufacturing methods that have led to restrictive practices.
   <p>Now a new threat to those who toil and spin has been developed by
a firm specialising in electronics in Los Angeles.
   <p>They have developed a new system whereby completely untrained
workers can be taught their trade by means of tape recordings and
television.
   <p>What happens is that the unskilled worker is processed, by
high-speed listening to recorded instructions on how to do the job
coupled with explanatory TV pictures, into becoming a highly
skilled, obedient craftsman in no time at all.
   <p>Not only can the raw human mind be technically equipped very
quickly to do one set of skilled manufacturing processes in one trade
but, by being given another of the new audio-TV training
techniques, he can be switched to a different industry if he just
gives in and listens and looks.
   <p>From being an assembler in an aircraft factory to becoming a
paint sprayer in a ceramic factory, he can be qualified for a
completely new job in less time than it takes to say <quote>Tolpuddle
Martyrs!</quote>
<head>A STRAIGHT THEODOLITE</head>
   <p><quote>CRICKET,</quote> says the Oxford Dictionary, is <quote>an open air game
played with ball, bats and wickets between two sides consisting of
eleven players each.</quote>
   <p>Not so, dear Oxford Dictionary.
   <p>You are out of date.
   <p>Cricket in 1961 is played with a theodolite, six surveyors, a
ball, bats and wickets between two sides.
   <p>Shades of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who are now the
patron saints of the game!
   <p>What would THEY have thought of these civil engineers
creeping about the pitch with their optical instruments?
   <p>The village green is the real home of cricket.
   <p>A couple of bumps on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman
with a stout heart, a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a mighty
six these days as rare as frostbite in summer.
   <p>They'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next.
<head>The Eichmann Mind</head>
   <p>EICHMANN continues to reveal the extraordinary watertight
divisions of the German mind.
   <p>Not content with arguing that he was only an efficient cog in the
machine, he now claims that his part of the endless massacre that led
to the death of six million Jews was <quote>decent, feasible and
workable.</quote>
   <p>He feels satisfaction <quote>from the fact that my personality had
been tested and weighed and not found wanting.</quote>
   <p>He feels like Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the
multitude saying: <quote>I am innocent of the blood of this just
person.</quote>
   <p>Like Dr. Globke, whom I interviewed the other day, Eichmann
said: <quote>I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I could
despite my low rank.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>Eichmann is on dangerous ground when he pleads that he was only a
small unit on the base of the triangle that led to Hitler, Himmler,
Hess and Goering at the apex.
   <p>In examination he betrayed an expert and intimate knowledge of
every link in the chain of command that led to the top. He understood
the whole apparatus with an exact and meticulous comprehension that
could only have come from a man who used the system &mdash; and used it with
power and authority.
   <p>The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid
themselves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are red
with blood.
   <p>They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles was an
iniquitous injustice. When they burst into Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Holland, Belgium and France they really believed Hitler when he
screamed at them that they were being <quote>encircled.</quote>
   <p>They really believed in the moral superiority of <quote>The New
Order</quote> which Himmler on October 4, 1943, expressed thus: <quote>Whether
nations live in prosperity or starve to death like cattle interests me
only in so far as we need them as slaves to our \Kultur; otherwise
it is of no interest to me.</quote>
<head>Dispatched...</head>
   <p>This concept of slavery included Britain.
   <p>General Brauchitsch signed a directive ordering that after the
successful invasion of our islands all the <quote>able-bodied male
population between the ages of seventeen and forty-five will, unless
the local situation calls for an exceptional ruling, be interned and
dispatched to the Continent.</quote>
   <p>The Baltic States were to have been our destination.
   <p>In no other conquered country, not even Poland, had the Germans
begun with such a drastic step.
   <p>There is no doubt that the compatriots of Eichmann would have
been as good as their evil word.
<head>Officious Efficiency</head>
   <p>THE Inland Revenue people have a thankless task.
   <p>But they do not make themselves less disliked by their attitude
to their customers &mdash; who incidentally pay their salaries.
   <p>Their demands are invariably couched in hectoring, out-of-date
language, but in spite of all their bluster, they let many a big fish
through the net while they are bullying the minnows.
   <p>I have just heard a good example of their officious efficiency.
   <p>A young chap I know got his first job last week. He is paid
monthly in arrears and will not get a bean for the next twenty-one
days.
   <p>But the blood suckers have already been after him, demanding
particulars in the usual minatory language including a blackmailing
line which says: <quote>If you do not do this, you may have to pay more
tax than you need.</quote>
   <p>Truly are the tax gatherers an unbeloved people.
<head>May His Tribe Increase</head>
   <p>MY favourite piece of rhymed writing, when I was young and in
the catapult-and-conker stage of life, was a piece of sentimental
verse by Leigh Hunt.
   <p>It was called <quote>Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel.</quote>
   <p>I don't know why I was so impressed with this poem but, on
reflection, it might be that I took a guilty interest in the devilment
business.
   <p>I may well have felt that I was hell-bound under a strict
Presbyterian upbringing and a possible reprieve might come through the
sugary sentiments of <quote>Abou Ben Adhem.</quote>
   <p>What happened in the jingly-jungly jingle was this:
   <p><quote>Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
   <p>Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
   <p>And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
   <p>Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
   <p>An Angel writing in a book of gold.</quote>
<head>More &mdash; or Less?</head>
   <p>To cut a long story short the Angel got on well with Abou and
wrote his name at the top of the book of gold.
   <p>However, I was only intrigued by the blessing ~<quote>May his tribe
increase!</quote>
   <p>I didn't realise, in my world of swarming, suburban kids in
which I was reared, that more of us might be considered a good thing.
   <p>But they were &mdash; and still are.
   <p>In Burma the Government is urging the population to multiply
because, says the Minister of National Planning: <quote>If present trends
continue and there is no increase, the Burmese will disappear one
day.</quote>
   <p>Not far away, across the Bay of Bengal, India's Government is
urging the population to have themselves sterilised and paying them to
have the operation.
   <p>But neither of these pluses and minuses affects the main picture.
   <p>The Earth is crammed with teeming, multiplying humanity.
   <p>The blessing ~<quote>May his tribe increase</quote> in 1961 sounds like
a curse. In our own country there are nearly 53 million of us. We
are more thickly populated than teeming, bursting Japan.
   <p>Only one country in the world has more people per square yard
than we have &mdash; Holland.
   <p>In 1850 there were 1,000 million people in the world. In 1900
the figure had swollen to &mdash; 1,500 million. Half a century later, us
chicks had increased by another 1,000 million to 2,500 million.
   <p>By 1975 we cannot, on present figures, be less than 3,800
million, and by the year Anno Domini 2000 (bar nuclear accidents)
we will be about 6,300 million in all.
   <p>There's going to be an awful lot of us around. Unless...
   <p>Un-nuclear less...
<head>Did They Know?</head>
   <p>I HAVE cast doubt on the repeated claims of the Germans that
they did not know of the appalling deeds that were inflicted on
millions of human beings for the glory and honour of the Third German
Reich.
   <p>Yesterday I received a letter from an ex-SS man now living
in England. He asks me not to publish his name and address <quote>as it
might well cost me my job.</quote>
   <p>He writes: <quote>Your statement that the German people knew what
happened to the Jews is wrong. From 1942-1944 I served as a volunteer
in the German SS. During that time I served in various SS
divisions and never heard the slightest rumour that Jews were
murdered.
   <p><quote>On the contrary we believed just as sincerely as the allies
that we were fighting for a just cause and humanity.
   <p><quote>We often fought against odds of twenty to one and got through.
You don't do that unless you have a deep conviction that your cause
is right.
   <p><quote>Our officers always told us never to degenerate to the level of
our opponents. Even when our patrol found two of our comrades
murdered (shot in the neck) by Russian troops who had captured them
the day before, we were told by our patrol leader: <squote>No reprisals.

<head>West German Build-up</head>
<head>Tories up to old tricks</head>
<head>says BOB LEESON</head>
   <p>SOME 17 years ago, in the early summer of 1934, the German
ambassador in London was dictating a secret report to his chief \von
Papen, in Berlin.
   <p><quote>Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion of German
rearmament, in opposition, to France.</quote>
   <p>Later that year he warned that Britain knew Germany was breaking
the agreement to stop building bombers, and added: <quote>Without
Britain's tolerance German rearmament in the air would be
jeopardised.</quote>
   <p>When Hoesch's reports, along with other nazi documents, were
captured and published after the war the pattern of British Government
connivance became clear.
   <p>At nazi Germany's request, Britain was providing the cloak for
Germany to build an air force bigger than that of France.
   <p>Yesterday West German Defence Minister, Herr Strauss, started
talks with the British Defence Minister, Mr. Watkinson.
   <p>Their talks are another stage in the cloak operation, 1961
variety, by which the West German militarists are advancing their
rearmament.
<head>Strauss' aim</head>
   <p>Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October that his policy
was to make his country the <quote>strongest militarily in Europe and the
United States' principal Nato ally.</quote>
   <p>His job is to build up the military apparatus which will back
West Germany's economic domination of Western Europe through the
Common Market.
   <p>He continued this week the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he
had in public at a Nato council meeting last year over the question:
do we fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war?
   <p>A 90-day war, the West German view, provides the pretext for huge
German armed forces (within Nato of course) and for those to have
bases all over Western Europe.
   <p>In the past year West Germany has secured agreements for
<quote>facilities</quote> in France, Holland and Belgium.
   <p>After much bargaining the British Government has agreed to give
similar <quote>facilities</quote> to German troops in Britain.
   <p>The process has been too slow for Herr Strauss and last month he
attacked Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's plans for a
<quote>unified supply apparatus</quote> in Nato. (A supply apparatus which
would link together the various West German <quote>facilities.</quote>)
   <p>By the end of the year there will be 11 German divisions in Nato
compared with four divisions of British troops.
   <p>Alongside these divisions a force of over 600 Starfighters
provided by the Americans is growing up. These <quote>fighters</quote> are in
fact fighter bombers which could launch an atomic attack on Eastern
Europe.
   <p>By 1963 the Germans plan to have nine missile battalions, with
288 missiles and 36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
(range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.
   <p>Last month West Germany was reported to be halfway toward this
target. Her position as <quote>America's principal Nato ally</quote> grows
stronger and stronger.
   <p>Now this target which Herr Strauss and his fellows have their
eyes on is control of the warheads to these weapons. General
Heusinger, the man who caused a great disturbance last autumn with his
demand of nuclear weapons for his army, now heads Nato's military
planning committee.
   <p>All this has been achieved through Nato under American
leadership. But a big role has been played not only by the British
Government but by Right-Wing Labour in this country.
   <p>They have helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany, in
pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet policy which brought disaster
in 1939.
<head>No bases!</head>
   <p>Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained and
Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in control.
   <p>Nato, far from being a means of controlling the German
militarists, is, in fact, the cover for building up their power.
   <p>What must Britain do?
   <p>Today, again, she has a key role. Let her tell men like Strauss
that he shall have no bases or <quote>facilities,</quote> no help in his quest
for atomic arms.
   <p>A policy which breaks with military alliances like Nato and seeks
friendship with the Soviet Union can prevent another betrayal like
that of the '30s.
<head>GAITSKELLISM IS BANKRUPT</head>

<head>HARRY SMITH</head>
<head>National president of the Association of Engineering and
Shipbuilding Draughtsmen, writing in his personal capacity:</head>
   <p>I WAS pleased to read J. R. Campbell's article, for,
as president of a union which fought for and still stands on the
policy decisions established at the Scarborough Labour Party
Conference I am appalled at the character of the current attack
against those decisions.
   <p>For many years my union had to present its views to the two major
conferences of the movement and take a licking. For us, unity meant
accepting unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the movement
and having a go next time.
   <p>Alongside many others, we conducted our fight by putting down
unambiguous alternatives to official policy and seeking to win
majorities for them.
<head>Obstruction</head>
   <p>When Scarborough carried our point of view we were naturally
delighted, more so because the alternatives had been put clearly to
the movement, which had then chosen a vigorous anti-Nato, anti-Tory,
anti-bomb and anti-German rearmament policy.
   <p>Hopes rose as we saw a perspective of sharp struggle based on
consistent lines of difference with the Tories.
   <p>Many members understood that the bread-and-butter struggles of
the union would become easier in the context of a movement advancing
to attack the Tories on the whole front of their policy.
   <p>For we have always felt, even if we have then by our practice
ignored it, the inconsistency between support for the war alliance,
with resulting colossal spending on armaments, and our basic effort to
improve living standards.
   <p>Instead, we saw the Gaitskellites using the position of
organisational dominance established during their years of control of
policy to offend every principle of democratic practice and unity.
   <p>They obstructed every effort to fight for the Scarborough
decisions, while scratching around frantically to overturn them next
time.
<head>Confusion</head>
   <p>Confusion of the original issue by misrepresentation of the
decisions, the introduction of a pseudo third way and the call for
party unity &mdash; in effect, a demand that the movement unite with the
Gaitskellites on their policy and no other seems to have done the
trick of moving a number of unions temporarily away from Scarborough
decisions.
   <p>It would become easy to become cynical and to despair. And yet,
wherever the issues were put clearly, sections of the movement
reaffirmed their original stand.
   <p>Only where the issues were posed so as to cause doubt and
confusion were positions lost.
   <p>It is my view that this immediate confusion hides the fact that
the Peace movement is still advancing and that clarification of the
issues can bring a majority to secure the Scarborough decisions.
   <p>Powerful units have stood firm. In unions where the central
issues were confused, clear policy details &mdash; as on bases &mdash; were
decisively carried.
<head>Peace policy</head>
   <p>This, and the numbers of active workers who are beginning to
understand how and why the trick was done, provides a strong,
immediate basis for a campaign against weak and doubtful positions,
and for a consistent peace policy.
   <p>All recent events show how correct the Scarborough decisions
were.
   <p>The Kennedy Administration's sharpened policies, the speeded-up
drive to improve West Germany's armament, the new attempt to rush
Britain into the European Common Market, and the kite-flying on Spain
present a whole new proof that to abandon Scarborough is to expose
Britain and her working class to sharp new dangers &mdash; that Gaitskellism
is bankrupt.
   <p>Ordinary working people will never rally to defend a policy
founded on political chicanery or elect a Labour Government to carry
through Tory policy &mdash; Gaitskell's stupid hope.
   <p>The tragedy is that enormous inroads could already have been made
into Tory strength by a fighting policy, based on Scarborough.
<head>ABE MOFFAT</head>
<head>Scottish Miners' leader:</head>
   <p>THE desire for unity in the Labour and trade union movement
following the discussions that have taken place during the past two
years on defence is something that should be recognised by all
concerned.
   <p>At the same time that unity cannot be established on a false
basis, or by creating further confusion within the movement.
   <p>Unity will never be established on the basis of leaders being a
law unto themselves and opposing conference decisions when it suits
their own convenience.
   <p>Unity can never be established by any formula uniting those who
oppose German troops being trained on British soil and Polaris, and
those who are for this policy &mdash; which is the same as that of the Tory
Government.
   <p>It is impossible for Labour's new Defence statement to unite the
movement as the Labour leaders are not only in favour of American
bases, but are in favour of German bases and troops being trained on
British soil.
   <p>The new Defence statement, while accepting that Britain cannot
remain an independent nuclear Power, now supports the policy of
depending on American nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing Britain
in an even more dangerous position.
   <p>The statement of Padley and Crossman is no different in principle
to the new defence statement. They accept American nuclear bases, and
also the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy until some future
date.
   <p>They deceive the people by their talk of political and collective
control of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly clear who
controls the American H-bomb, and who will actually give the
instructions to press the button for nuclear warfare.
   <p>There is only one way to develop unity and at the same time
defend Britain.
   <p>This was shown at the Scottish Trades Union Congress,
representing 800,000 organised trade unionists, when it decided by
overwhelming votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions on
unilateral disarmament, and to oppose Polaris and military bases being
installed on the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.
<head>Tory menace</head>
   <p>Such a policy would unite the whole movement and lay the basis
for the defeat of the present Tory Government, which has become a real
menace to the British people both in home and foreign policy.
   <p>It is quite evident that the movement will go on record against
the Polaris base and facilities for German bases and military
training.
   <p>This should strengthen the campaign to end the manufacture and
use of nuclear weapons in Britain.
   <p>Britain then could play a leading and independent role for an
international agreement to ban all nuclear strategy and weapons of
mass destruction, and lay the basis for real peace and progress.
<head>Ballyhoo Won't Solve Youth Training</head>
<head>says JOHN MOSS</head>
   <p>WHEN all the ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training Week subsides
it is doubtful whether more than a handful of new apprenticeships will
result.
   <p>This week of window dressing will not prevent most of the hopeful
15-year-olds leaving school in six weeks time from ending up in blind
alley jobs.
   <p>It needs more than 10,000 church parades and open days at techs,
more than descents into Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to catch up with the
space age.
   <p>The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh, opening a few technical
college extensions, will not keep us abreast of the scientific
revolution.
   <p>Out of the 550,000 young people aged 15-17 starting work in 1960
420,000 (73 per cent) went into unskilled work. The percentage is
expected to swell to 80 next year.
<head>Low wages</head>
   <p>The Duke, possibly speaking from experience, stated: <quote>Most
unskilled jobs are reasonably well-paid and many look attractive.</quote>
   <p>But last year's average wage for boys under 21 was &pound;5 4s and
for girls &pound;4 13s. If a minority got as much as the Press says they
do, then those below average must have received a pittance.
   <p>Apprentice wages are below average: a 19-year-old engineering
apprentice may get as little as &pound;5 8s 1d.
   <p>But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people prefer
unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training are denied it.
   <p>One area electricity board in 1958 offered six craft
apprenticeships and received 450 applications, of whom 100 were
considered suitable by the board.
   <p>There were only 17 vacancies for the 58 boys who passed the
Admiralty exams for Rosyth dockyard last year.
   <p>A small number of recently widely publicised apprenticeships
demanded seven passes in G.C.E.

<head>Getting Ready for the Budget</head>
<head>1. Tax Reforms for the 1960s</head>
<head>By DAVID HOWELL</head>

   <p>THERE are two basic points which seem to be a necessary
preface to any sensible discussion of taxation reform.
   <p>The first is that, whether we like it or not, with the increasing
demands of a prosperous society, the revenue required by central and
local government in the coming years is highly unlikely to get any
smaller.
   <p>The assumption of this article is, therefore, that most of the
<quote>natural</quote> increase in the revenue in 1961, due to increased wages,
salaries, consumption and profits, will be needed by the Chancellor.
If he does have &pound;100m. or so to return to the taxpayer then
indication is given as to where his priorities should lie.
   <p>The second point to be made is that tax reform is a very
different thing from putting forward a radical scheme for altering the
whole tax structure.
   <p>Raising the revenue is already a major administrative miracle.
The only proposals for change which can be labelled practical are
those which involve the minimum administrative complications when set
beside the existing structure.
<head>The Objectives</head>
   <p>THIS said, it is nevertheless worthwhile trying to define
some of the long-run objectives towards which tax reformers should
aim. For although progress may be slow, it is no less important to
have a clear idea about the direction in which all tax changes should
go &mdash; something noticeably lacking in recent years.
   <p>The objectives might be listed like this:

   <p>1 &mdash; that the system should be efficient.
   <p>2 &mdash; that it should be fair as between one taxpayer and
another.
   <p>3 &mdash; that it should encourage personal saving and the wider
spread of ownership of assets and property.
   <p>4 &mdash; that it should contain the minimum disincentive to, and
where possible should actively encourage, risk-taking, enterprise,
exports and investment in efficient production methods.

   <p>It is the last of these four objectives about which we have heard
most in the past year. With a disappointing export performance and a
slow rate of economic expansion many people have been turning to the
taxation system as the source of the trouble, citing individual cases.
Yet strangely enough it is here that there is least evidence that the
present system offends.
   <p>Nevertheless, the grumbles and complaints are too frequent to be
ignored. It is, therefore, with direct taxes on income (income tax
and surtax) and capital (death duties and stamp duty) that we will
begin.
   <p>When talking of our highly progressive system of income tax
we often forget that below &pound;2,000 the taxpayer is only charged at
progressive rates over a band of &pound;360. Otherwise he (or she) is
either paying no tax at all or the full standard rate. A sensible
first step, therefore, would be to make the ascent to the standard
rate more gentle and less forbidding to the millions who are now
attempting it.
   <p>Further up the scale, where progression starts again with
surtax, one of the most painful transition periods for the
taxpayer is when he has to start writing a surtax cheque instead of
having tax taken off by PAYE.
   <p>There is no obstacle in principle or in administration against
the abolition of the concept of surtax altogether and the continuation
of the income tax scale to the top.
   <p>Even with this change the PAYE deductions at the top end
would still be at a near-confiscatory rate. The real objection to
taking away more than, say, 15s in every pound a man earns, is not
so much that it is unfair or discouraging to the nation's decision
makers, but that the imposition is grossly inefficient.
   <p>Businessmen threatened with these high rates merely spend more
and more time with their accountants seeing how their incomes can be
kept out of this range. The temptations increase to draw benefits in
kind, and sometimes in unnecessary business expenses, rather than
taxable income.
   <p>The cost to the Exchequer of placing a ceiling of 15s in the &pound;
on direct personal taxation would be about &pound;20m. This should be
done.
   <p>Two other important aspects of income taxation worry people. The
first is the tax status of married women. Where the husband and
wife's combined incomes come to less than &pound;2,100 (where surtax for a
married couple without children starts), they have a slight advantage
over single persons. But above this level they are severely
penalised.
   <p>When shortage of labour is one of the main checks on our scope
for increasing output rapidly, the case for making separate
assessments seems particularly strong. The cost to the Exchequer of
separate assessments for surtax (or, as we have redefined it, income
tax above &pound;2,100) on earned income alone, but not on investment
income, would be only &pound;4m. This would still be an encouraging
start.
<head>Capital Gains</head>
   <p>THE second source of concern is the widely-held suspicion
that a number of professional dealers in property and shares pay no
taxes since their <quote>income</quote> is mostly in the form of untaxed capital
gains. It is from this suspicion that the main support for a
capital gains tax comes.
   <p>The trouble with a capital gains tax is that it hits so many
other things as well, including small savings and the smooth working
of the capital market, besides being of low and uncertain yield. It
is generally recognised as a second best to much more radical schemes
for transferring the main burden of taxation from income to
expenditure.
   <p>But the alternative suggestion that the Inland Revenue should
apply its power to levy tax more vigorously against those who earn
<quote>regular</quote> capital gains raises almost insuperable problems of legal
definition.
   <p>Thus a capital gains tax, for all its obvious deficiencies, is
not without its advocates in all parties. There is no need to regard
it for ever as an unmentionable heresy, nor as a general panacea. It
can be discussed on purely empirical grounds.
   <p>This raises the question of capital taxes on the individual. One
of the weaknesses of Conservative government has been its reluctance
to use the tax system as an instrument of policy as its Labour
predecessors did freely. On the contrary, Conservatives have been
content to accept a system which works directly against their declared
objective of more widespread property ownership.
   <p>Estate Duty is a good example. The main victims of Estate
Duty (which yields about &pound;185m.) are not ageing millionaires, who
can easily make provision to avoid paying it, but middle-aged owners
of small family firms, whose death often means the liquidation of the
firm to pay death duties, in spite of the 45 per cent. rebate
allowed on the industrial assets of a business, assessed at market
value. The tax should long since have been replaced by a Legacy
Duty &mdash; duty paid on the inheritance received rather than what is left.
   <p>This would actively encourage the spread of property and would
allow small firms to pass into wider family ownership without forcing
them to close down. It is hard to estimate how much loss to the
Revenue the changeover, keeping the same rates, would involve, but a
figure of &pound;30m. has been quoted.
<head>More Incentives</head>
   <p>FURTHER incentives to small savers are also long overdue.
Stamp Duty on share transactions is prohibitively high for the
newcomer with less than &pound;500 to invest and exemptions could be made
for sums under this.
   <p>If the Chancellor really wanted to get more people into the
saving and investing habit he could, without difficulty, go further
and give relief on the first slice of an individual's income from his
investments. For the coming year the cost of these two concessions
should be adjusted to about &pound;50m.
   <p>This still leaves an important area of direct taxation uncovered
company taxation. At present net company profits are taxed at the
standard income tax rate plus a 12 1/2 per cent. profits tax. The
smoothing out of income tax rates, without any special concept of a
<quote>standard rate</quote> or surtax levels, as I have suggested, would mean
that companies would have to be taxed on a separate schedule.
   <p>The obvious candidate to replace the present complicated two-part
system (which includes investment allowance reliefs) would be the
straight corporation tax. This could have the added advantage of
flexibility (it could be varied independently from personal taxes) and
speed, since it could be assessed on a current year basis.
   <p>It does raise certain difficulties with regard to double taxation
of dividends. But these have been successfully overcome abroad.
   <p>In these ways the more painful, inefficient and discouraging
aspects of our taxation system could be modified, at a cost of little
more than the amount which, on the gloomiest view, the Chancellor may
have to spare &mdash; just over &pound;100m.
   <p>But little has yet been said about the way in which we might
start shifting some of the burden of tax from income and earning (what
we put into the pool) on to spending (what we take out of it), and
about the main existing indirect tax, purchase tax.
   <p>It seems to me that discussion of changes in this field can be
most usefully combined with a look at local government finance.
<head>Getting Ready for the Budget &mdash; 2</head>
<head>Why Not a Local Sales Tax?</head>
<head>DAVID HOWELL</head>
   <p>WHEN the idea of more taxes on spending is canvassed, it is
sometimes overlooked that we already have a kind of sales tax on a
wide range of goods in the form of purchase tax. The estimated yield
from purchase tax in 1960-61 is &pound;535m. In addition, the estimated
revenue from customs and excise duty on tobacco, beer and spirits is
&pound;1,229m.
   <p>The other taxes on spending are the oil tax and tariff charges,
which together have an estimated yield of &pound;580m. Thus any
suggestions for a further impost on spending in the form of a sales
tax have to be made with these important taxes firmly in mind.
   <p>Purchase tax, at four rates varying from five to 50 per cent.,
spreads its net so wide that it is almost simpler to list some of the
items not affected. Food and sweets, fuel and light are not taxed;
nor are books, magazines, children's clothes, some kitchen equipment,
sheets and towels.
   <p>No services bear any kind of tax. On the other hand, a wide
range of consumer durables is affected; so are most household goods
and appliances; and so, too, are cosmetics, radios, records,
jewellery, toys, cameras, carpets, wallpaper, most clothes, hats,
gloves and furniture.
   <p>Thus if goods alone are considered, few items are free of a
spending tax of some kind, and those that are include a number of
goods which it is rightly considered undesirable to tax. For these
reasons it is usually argued that the first move towards a sales tax
should be to modify the purchase-tax system into a uniform percentage
rate tax and that this should be extended, if administratively
possible and right in principle to tax.
<head>High and Wide</head>
   <p>Some calculations were done for Lord Amory when he was
Chancellor on this basis and the conclusion was reached that a uniform
sales tax over the widest possible range of goods would have to be
levied at 20 per cent. to yield the same revenue as purchase tax.
   <p><quote>The widest possible range</quote> chosen could, in fact, have been
wider. Some consumer services, and clothing, furniture and luxury
food items, taxed in other countries, were excluded. Had they not
been a figure of about 17 per cent. might have been reached.
   <p>But this is still impracticably high. Moreover, this would
replace purchase tax alone. If we wished to reduce income tax as
well, the level of a sales tax would have to be well above 20 per
cent.
   <p>The real trouble with this kind of approach, which inevitably
points to a very high rate of tax, is its assumption from the start
that the proposed sales tax has to be a major revenue-raiser for the
central government. Yet in those countries where a sales tax has
worked most successfully, it has been employed as an additional source
of revenue for the local or provincial government.

<head>NOW WHO'S TIPPED FOR No. 10?</head>
<head>by WALTER TERRY</head>
   <p>WITH one mighty spurt, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd has dashed from his
rut and is now in the race for real power within the Conservative
Party.
   <p>In so intensive a contest the most difficult task of all is to
judge one's timing properly. Mr. Lloyd has done this superbly with
his Budget.
   <p>Once he was a non-starter. Today he is running well along the
track towards No. 10 Downing Street.
   <p>But wait a minute &mdash; Selwyn Lloyd, the little Liverpool lawyer, as
he was contemptuously described a few years back, as Prime Minister?
Laughable, they used to say. The man could hardly make a decent
speech, fluffing and floundering over a dreary brief.
<head>Dominant</head>
   <p>BUT Mr. Lloyd as Prime Minister is ridiculous no more. The
very thought, I am sure, has struck Mr. R. A. Butler, Home
Secretary and apparently the heir to Downing Street.
   <p>For Mr. Lloyd, old nerves gone and seemingly dominant for the
first time in his political career, has made a tremendous impact on
the Tories of Westminster with his Budget.
   <p>Maybe they don't like some of its detail, specially the payroll
tax. But the key significance is that for the first time in ten years
of power a Tory leader has produced an alternative programme to
Butlerism.
   <p>For years many Conservatives, disgruntled but not quite clear
what they wanted, have been searching for something to match the
liberal, radical-type Toryism that Mr. Butler has inspired.
<head>Unafraid</head>
   <p>DRAMATICALLY, Mr. Lloyd has emerged &mdash; a Chancellor willing
to grapple with the economy, unafraid of it. A politician of
endurance (as proved over Suez), able also to produce new ideas that
can excite.
   <p>Mr. Lloyd's timing has been miraculously fortunate. His Budget
has come immediately after a week in which Mr. Butler fared badly.
   <p>Mr. Butler, a humanitarian who dislikes corporal punishment,
was openly flouted by 69 Tories in the biggest Conservative revolt
since the war.
   <p>Next day another 15 disobeyed his advice over the Wedgwood Benn
affair. Result at the weekend: Mr. Butler's stock suffered a
remarkable drop. Then into the limelight stepped Selwyn.
   <p>It is not only Mr. Butler, the deserving candidate for Downing
Street, who is in trouble. So are many other prominent contenders for
the Premiership in the radical sector of the party.
   <p>Mr. Iain Macleod, supremely able but facing frightful
dilemmas as Colonial Secretary, is set back by the revolt, inspired by
Lord Salisbury, against his Africa policies.
   <p>Mr. Reginald Maudling, President of the Board of Trade, is
disappointed. He would like to have been Chancellor. Now he is being
tempted by Beeching-sized offers to leave politics and go into
business.
   <p>Mr. Edward Heath, Lord Privy Seal and Deputy Foreign
Secretary, has not succeeded so far in turning his shadowy role into
substance.
   <p>And Viscount Hailsham, a radical Tory even if he would
dislike being labelled a Left-winger, is down in the dumps of the
whimsically named Ministry for Science.
   <p>Cast a glance along the Right Wing: it is there that success lies
at the moment.
   <p>Lord Home is wielding immense power at the Foreign Office.
Duncan Sandys works quietly as Secretary of State at the
Commonwealth Office; and Mr Henry Brooke, the Minister of
Housing and Local Government is almost ready to take up the promotion
that is his due.
   <p>Over them all is Mr. Macmillan, silent about his own
future. In about 18 months or so he will have to make it clear to the
Conservative Party whether he intends to fight for another term of
office at the next election or make way for a successor.
<head>Adored</head>
   <p>THE Prime Minister has never given the slightest indication
who he considers should follow him in office.
   <p>It has always been presumed to be Mr. Butler. In everything
but title he is Deputy Premier. He holds the reins of power over
party and domestic policy.
   <p>But Mr. Butler's everlasting disadvantage has been the
undercurrent within the party against him. After Suez it rose to the
surface to rob him of the Premiership.
   <p>It still lies waiting (though Mr. Butler has been an able
fellow at winning friends over the years) for a chance to cheat him
again.
   <p>Now Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, sponsoring a Budget that is strictly
Right Wing, adored by Tory constituency parties, and an intimate of
the Prime Minister, is on the scene with just as much power and
authority as Mr. Butler ever had.
<head>Clever</head>
   <p>WHEN you think about it, Mr. Lloyd owes it all to Mr.
Macmillan. As Foreign Secretary he could have been sacked at any
time. Hardly anyone would have wept. Uphill, against current
thinking in the party, he was promoted Chancellor by the Prime
Minister.
   <p>Maybe a scheme is coming to fruition. Can it be that the Prime
Minister has been grooming Selwyn all along for the highest office of
all?
   <p>There are plenty of Tories now who are ready to believe it. The
Prime Minister is not only very clever. He has an uncanny habit of
thinking years ahead of his colleagues.
<head>INTIMATELY REVEALED... FRANCE'S MAN OF THE CENTURY... AND THE HOUR</head>
<head>Yes, his sight is failing but not his vision...</head>
<head>by MAURICE EDELMAN M P</head>
   <p>HAS \de Gaulle lost his grip? Is the old chieftain who has
won so many battles and crushed so many revolts now to be eaten by the
young warriors of the tribe?
   <p>I have known \de Gaulle for 17 years. I first met him when he
was the young, defiant leader of the Free French, in Algiers on the
eve of his putsch against General Giraud.
   <p>Since that day I have been fascinated by the paradoxical
personality of France's greatest leader.
   <p>Has he the strength left now in 1961 to pull it off again? I
believe he has.
   <p>His power lies in his curious contradictions. He is, for
instance, a professional soldier. And yet, once again, he is called
on to resist the French Army.
   <p>He is a devout Roman Catholic. And yet he is drawing on support
from the anti-clerical left.
   <p>He is often accused of being a dictator. And yet he is today
fighting a battle against militant dictatorship.
<head>HIS INTEGRITY</head>
   <p>THE greater part of the professional Army is ranged against
him. But there is no doubt that the concentrated strength of the
French people is behind him, because of a respect for his integrity
which no French soldier or civilian has commanded in this century.
   <p>Physically, he is a sick man. His sight is failing him; he
suffers from a cataract of both eyes. That is the principal reason
why he never speaks with notes; he couldn't read them if he had them.
   <p>He memorises all his speeches, and when he was in England in 1959
I congratulated him on his memory. He told me that it had always been
good ever since he studied philosophy at the Jesuit College in Paris,
before going to St. Cyr, the French Sandhurst.
   <p>Spectacles could do something for his eyesight, but he won't wear
them because of a pardonable vanity which makes him feel that
spectacles are unsuitable for a man fulfilling the role of
soldier-father of the French people.
   <p>As the family man, the father who each Sunday visits the grave of
his daughter Anne in the medieval church of Colombey-les-deux-Eglises,
he is a figure which the ordinary Frenchman and Frenchwoman
understand.
   <p>That is why even the Communists, who number millions in France,
although officially opposing him during the last referendum which
endorsed his Algerian solution, are in very many cases his secret
backers.
   <p>For the first time since 1945 the Communist, Socialist, and
Catholic trade unions have rallied in agreement. They will provide
the active leadership and civilian resistance to the Algiers mutiny
which the inert mass of the French middle classes &mdash; the \attentistes
or fence sitters &mdash; are unlikely to offer and which \de Gaulle is
unlikely to expect them to offer.
   <p>Like most supremely powerful men he believes in his <quote>destiny.</quote>
<head>HIS NATURE</head>
   <p>HE sees himself marked out as the saviour of France. And in
the course of his often dangerous and adventurous life he has said
many times that he possesses the <quote>\baraka,</quote> an Arab word which
means the divine blessing which protects its bearer from evil.
   <p>But this Joan of Arc mentality does not mean that he is lost in
the clouds. It is balanced by an icy, calculating nature, a quality
he learned from his father who was a teacher of philosophy at Lille.
   <p>He has always been predictable, in the sense that once he has
made his position clear all his actions flow logically from that
position. It is certain that he would never yield to the blackmail of
the insubordinate generals.
<head>HIS POLICY</head>
   <p>IT is this strange mixture of mysticism and rational logic
which makes what is perhaps his most powerful contradiction.
   <p>As a mystic (a quality inherited from his mother) he regards
himself as France's predestined deliverer.
   <p>As a rationalist (inherited from his father) he anticipated the
Algiers revolt by rallying the French people behind him, and making
the issue of his Algerian policy a straight one between the
professional soldiers with their vested interest in war and the French
people with their vested interest in peace.
   <p>The last word may well be with the Army &mdash; not the clique of
Salan, but the army of conscript soldiers, whose hearts must be with
their families on the mainland of France.
<head>This Clore touch at the Post Office</head>
<head>by JOHN HALL</head>

   <p>I MIGHT have been listening to Mr. Clore or Mr. Cotton.
   <p><quote>In cities and towns all over the country, grubby Victorian
buildings sitting on magnificent central sites,</quote> the man at the
other side of the desk was saying. <quote>Sites worth millions, asking for
redevelopment, begging for the old buildings to be razed and replaced
with new money-spinners.</quote>
   <p>But it wasn't either of the Mr. Cs speaking &mdash; or any other
property tycoon.
   <p>It was Mr. Reginald Bevins, the Postmaster-General, and he was
talking about &mdash; our post offices, the old ones, the shabby relics of
another age, and the plans he has to give them the Clore-Cotton
treatment.
   <p><quote>I've had a firm of specialists make a pilot survey and it is
most encouraging. In site after site all over the country there's a
lot of money waiting for us to collect, money we can put to good use
improving our services.</quote>
   <p>Property tycoonery in the G.P.O. &mdash; what's happening?
   <p>Just this: After years of subservience the G.P.O. has been
liberated from the clutches of the Treasury. It is as free as makes
no matter to <quote>go it alone</quote> as a strictly business concern, and that
is Mr. Bevins' aim.
   <p>From here on we can call it the G.P.O., Ltd., and fall in
with the unofficial title the G.P.O. staff have given Mr.
Bevins.
   <p>To them this 52-year-old ex-elementary schoolboy from Liverpool
is no longer the P.M.G. He is The Chairman. And with his
Guardsman's silhouette and his iron-grey hair, and his quiet, incisive
speech he looks the part too &mdash; executive director model.
   <p>I went to see The Chairman to ask him about the new G.P.O.
He told me: <quote>Although we are a State monopoly our aim is to be as
competitive as if we had rivals breathing down our necks.</quote>
   <p>He means it. Almost before the Treasury ties had been severed he
sent down the line a directive which comes pretty close to the
customer-is-always-right precept.
<head>Changing</head>
   <p>THE odd telephone operator who snaps at us; the occasional
clerk behind the counter in the Post Office who glares when we fumble
or are not quite sure what we want: The Chairman is after them.
   <p>From June 1, in all except the biggest post offices, there will
be no segregation at the counters: no segregation in the sense that
whether we want stamps, postal orders, or both, we will be able to
march up to any station on the counter and get them from the same
assistant.
   <p>I asked about television &mdash; colour television.

<head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</head>
<head>Need to disperse immigrants</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; While I fully endorse your attitude to the Commonwealth
Immigrants Bill, and am repelled by that section of its supporters who
detergently echo the racialist slogan, ~<quote>Keep Britain White,</quote>
nevertheless I urge that the particular problem of immigrants from any
source crowding into congested areas in London, Birmingham, and
elsewhere must not be evaded.
   <p>This does not at present affect my own constituency of Leyton,
but there are other areas where immigrants can only find lodging under
deplorable circumstances or by acquiring houses that could have been
occupied by those who have been waiting for reasonable accommodation
for many weary years.
   <p>Hospitality is an excellent virtue, but not when the guests have
to sleep in rows in the cellar! No wonder some returning immigrants
have spoken bitterly of the wretched conditions under which they have
been compelled to live, even if they forget that is the plight also of
white brethren.
   <p>Surely, in the interest alike of our indigenous inhabitants and
of immigrants who have made and can make a valuable contribution to
our economic needs, it is imperative to enforce dispersal of newcomers
to less congested areas and substantially to expand house-building.
If this is not done reprehensible racial prejudice will, alas, be
encouraged and mischievously exploited. &mdash; Yours etc.,
   <p>R. W. Sorensen.
   <p>House of Commons.
<head>Polarisation of the Labour Party</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Nothing could illustrate the polarisation of the Labour
Party more aptly than the behaviour of Mrs Sylvia Brooks, who claims
to be a member of the Hornsey Labour Party and bitterly attacks a
speech I made as a guest speaker in Hornsey the other day. She
attributes to me the words ~<quote>The worst country under socialism is
better than the best country under capitalism,</quote> and then claims that
the Labour Party will only flourish when it gets rid of people like
myself who <quote>consider freedom relatively unimportant.</quote>
   <p>Fortunately the part of my speech to which she refers was
reported in the <quote>Hornsey Journal</quote> which quotes me correctly as
saying: <quote>The last ten years have proved that the most backward
totalitarian form of socialism is superior to the decadent type of
capitalism we have in the Western world. The only alternative to
communism is democratic socialism with planning and freedom combined.
The issue is whether we can get the people to see this in time.</quote>
   <p>Does Mrs Brooks think it really helps the Labour Party that she
should seek to smear me by deliberate and malicious
misrepresentation? &mdash; Yours truly,
   <p>R. H. S. Crossman.
   <p>House of Commons.
<head>Anomalies of the wage pause policy</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Is not the Government's failure to convince the nation
of the necessity of the wage pause very largely due to its failure to
present a policy with conviction, clarity, and imagination?
   <p>What, for example, is the <quote>plain man</quote> expected to make of the
Prime Minister's recent forecast of a &pound;20 minimum wage for the lowest
paid workers in ten years' time; the undertaking by Lord Robens
shortly afterwards that coal prices would not rise for five years
(broken this very morning); and the Prime Minister's repeated warnings
that the Common Market will demand real competitive pricing of our
products &mdash; and all this in the context of a pay <quote>pause</quote>?
   <p>Moreover, the plain man cannot understand how the country's
future can possibly depend upon a pause in the pay claims of the few.
If, as is asserted, the pause is so vital to the country's economy,
why not invite us all to share it? Indeed, why does not the
Government begin with a voluntary 10 per cent cut in the tax-free pay
of MPs, as did the Churchillian Government in the early days of
the war?
   <p>The Government, too, must make up its mind as to whether we need
a stable economy or a fluctuating one, whether the cost of living is
to continue to rise (the promise of a &pound;20 minimum) or whether it
should be stabilised, as it so easily could be.
   <p>Finally, the crux of this matter is surely not wages, but
spending power. The higher income groups and those whose incomes are
derived from sources other than wages are deliberately put outside
this pause; yet it is common knowledge that these groups, as groups,
spend lavishly. For the present Government to ignore this aspect of
the situation is to create its own opposition on a far wider than
party scale, and can only lead to a defeat of its own half-hearted
appeals. &mdash; Yours etc.,
   <p>S. J. Streek.

   <p>Sir, &mdash; How silly can we get? If the Treasury official really
believes that <quote>money is in the Bank of England</quote> just as jackets and

<head>BEA services in Scotland</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; In the <quote>Guardian</quote> of November 24 Lord Douglas is
quoted as saying of the Toothill Committee's report on BEA
services in Scotland that ~<quote>For sheer ingratitude, this report is
hard to beat.</quote> He is further reported as saying that the Scottish
service is subsidised by the profitable BEA Continental service,
and that the best place for this section of the Toothill Report is the
waste-paper basket.
   <p>I suspect that the waste-paper basket is Lord Douglas's filing
cabinet for many good ideas which might be presented to BEA. But
is it not the duty of a common carrier system which operates on a
monopoly basis to provide adequate service to all parts of the
country? Or are they only obliged to offer service where profitable
to them? Is it not the nature of the business to offset the losses of
one line with the profits of another? And if Lord Douglas is so
distressed about the loss incurred by the Scottish service, why has
BEA been so reluctant to allow any other airlines an opportunity
to provide service?
   <p>The attitude of BEA towards internal service is reflected in
their London booking office. Vast gleaming counters await the
prospective Continental traveller. The internal passengers need a
native guide and the Gods on their side to find the booking counter
allotted to them. For Lord Douglas's information, Scotland extends
beyond Edinburgh and Glasgow. There is Aberdeen, Inverness, Wick, and
the islands. During the summer holiday season or New Year holiday a
passenger can get from London to Edinburgh with only a little

<head>Deceived by Hitler?</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Mr R. H. S. Crossman proclaims, in his article in
Monday's issue of the <quote>Guardian</quote>: <quote>The white-washing of
Chamberlain is completed by the claim that he was never deceived by
Hitler and never believed in the possibility of a general peace
settlement with him.</quote>
   <p>On Tuesday, March 23, 1942, the Joint Consultation Board of
Standard Telephone and Cables held its fourth ordinary meeting.
According to the minutes of that meeting, the visitor was
Air-Commodore H. Leedham, who, in the course of his talk, said that
Chamberlain, on his return from Munich, requested that 20 RDF
stations be established around the coast before the next April.
   <p>It would seem, therefore, that Chamberlain did not trust Hitler;
if he did he would have been most unlikely to request the
establishment of those stations. &mdash; Yours faithfully,

<head>A Radical alliance</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; May I, as an active Liberal in my own constituency,
sympathise most warmly with Mr R. A. Buchanan's plea for a
Liberal-Labour election arrangement. In spite of post-Moss Side,
post-Oswestry, and cosy Liberal optimism it will be some years yet
before the Liberal Party can form a Government, while it is obvious
that the unique event of a Labour majority in the Commons is unlikely
to be repeated.
   <p>But what we need is not a Lib.-Lab. pact but a new party; not
coalition but coalescence. Is it too much to hope that the Radicals,
now sprinkled in all three parties, may one day be united and that the
Liberal Party may find itself the anchor of a new radical alliance? &mdash;

<head>Letters to the Editor</head>
<head>The bill for drugs</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; If Mr. Corina wishes to make two mutually exclusive
propositions he will be well advised not to publish them in the same
journal in the same month. On November 9 he states: <quote>Since price
restraint became operative the industry has won success in export
markets.</quote> This must mean that he believes that the advent of price
restraint in 1957 (the Voluntary Price Regulation Scheme) resulted in
substantially increased drug exports after 1957. But in his letter
twelve days later he states: <quote>In the period 1957-59 the volume of
exports fell by 1.2 per cent.</quote> At least one of the propositions
must be incorrect.
   <p>Mr. Corina says that the Hinchliffe Report <quote>showed quite
clearly</quote> that between 1949-50 and 1959-60 the total cost of the
Health Service rose by 80 per cent. I am unable to find this
reference in the report &mdash; which is hardly surprising as it was
published in 1959 and its latest reference to costs is in the
financial year 1957-58. What the Hinchliffe Report does say on page
27, paragraph 63, is: <quote>These figures do not support the general
belief that the cost of the pharmaceutical service is increasing at a
much faster rate than that of other branches of the National Health
Service or that it is absorbing an increasing share in the total cost
of the Service.</quote>
   <p>If the rise in the drug bill is <quote>phenomenal</quote> the rise in the
total Health Service bill must also be phenomenal, as both have gone
up at much the same rate. However, in his recent book, <quote>Health
through Choice,</quote> Dr. D. S. Lees, Senior Lecturer in Economics
at the University College of North Staffordshire states: <quote>Between
1949-50 and 1959-60... health expenditure fell as a proportion of
social service expenditure from 28 per cent to 23 per cent, and as a
proportion of gross national product from 4 per cent to 3.9 per cent.
Far from being extravagant, expenditure on NHS has been less
than consumers would probably have chosen to spend in a free
market.</quote> It therefore comes as no shock to read Dr. Lees's
conclusion on the drug bill: <quote>It would seem that much of the furore
over drug costs has been misplaced.</quote> &mdash; Yours faithfully,

<head>Diplomacy and trade</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; During extensive travelling in many parts of the world
seeking export trade, I have often criticised the lack of facilities
accorded to business men by some British embassies and our official
commercial representatives in foreign capitals.
   <p>For a change I would like to pay tribute to our embassies in
Spain and Portugal for providing examples of just what can be done to
foster British trade. I held receptions for leading figures in the
motor industries in Spain and Portugal, and in both Madrid and Lisbon
my efforts to promote new trade were actively supported by the British
Ambassadors, who not only saw to it that my visits were widely known
but personally came to the receptions and introduced me to useful
contacts.
   <p>In Spain, in particular, where 300 people attended a reception,
there was official British representation at all levels, and I was
immensely encouraged by the splendid effort made, particularly by our
own British information service. Indeed the joint effort between
embassy personnel and first-rate Spanish agents demonstrated to me for
the first time in my long experience just what 100 per cent
co-ordination can achieve. Surely what can be accomplished in Spain
can be done by our embassies all over the world. &mdash; Yours faithfully,

<head>Directors' Rewards</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Mr. Aucott (August 21) implies that all expenses
incurred by directors on behalf of their companies should be disclosed
to shareholders.
   <p>The law on this subject is perfectly equitable: if the expenses
in question are disallowed by the Inspector of Taxes &mdash; in other words,
they were not <quote>wholly exclusively and necessarily</quote> incurred &mdash; then
quite properly they are shown in the accounts under <quote>Directors'
Emoluments.</quote> Where, however, such expenses were <quote>wholly
exclusively and necessarily</quote> incurred they were plainly not
remuneration in the hands of the directors and cannot therefore be
shown as such in the accounts.
   <p>Mr. Aucott is not, I hope, suggesting that the standards of
honesty in British companies today are such as to require that every
penny spent by a director in performing his duties should be declared
to the shareholders.

<head>Exports on a Plateau</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; I feel that the letter from Mr. E. J. Bunbury,
August 22, cannot go unanswered. To begin with, Mr. Bunbury assumes
that the Chancellor's measures are sensible and correct and are likely
to achieve the objects desired.
   <p>It has been repeatedly pointed out that the Chancellor's measures
to restrict sales in the home market in order to increase exports are
quite mistaken and are having the opposite result. There is already
ample statistical evidence available to prove this is the case.
   <p>It is not correct to say that none of the Chancellor's critics
have put forward a practical alternative. Perhaps you would allow me
to state the alternative which a considerable number of people believe
infinitely preferable to the present patchwork and uneffective
measures.
   <p>The Chancellor must take steps to curtail inessential exports.
It is perfectly ridiculous in the present serious situation to allow
people to fritter away hard-earned foreign exchange on the purchase of
rubbish and things we could perfectly well do without. The most
effective way to achieve this would be to revive the control of
availability of foreign exchange. Indeed, the Chancellor is already
doing this, but unfortunately, because he will not face up to the true
issues involved, he is tackling it at the wrong end. He is cutting
off availability of foreign exchange to people who would use it to
create an overseas investment which would ultimately yield a return
instead of cutting it off to people who would merely waste it in
buying a lot of rubbish.

<head>Butter Dumping</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; I was interested to read the article by your Commercial
Editor on butter (August 21). I ought not to have to express my
ignorance to such a degree, but I find it very difficult to understand
how it is possible for another country to invoke anti-dumping
legislation inside the U.K. Surely the three sections primarily
concerned are the citizens of this country in their dual capacity of
taxpayers and consumers, together with our own farmers?
   <p>The point I really wish to make, though with great sympathy for
both Denmark and New Zealand, is that anti-dumping legislation is
primarily designed to protect a country's home industry, and it would
be setting a most undesirable precedent if rival exporting countries
and companies are permitted to apply for discriminatory action in
their mutual overseas markets. Should we join the Common Market, it
is appreciated that dumping will be prohibited between members, but
this is quite a different problem from that now raised by Denmark and
New Zealand.

<head>Potato Acreage</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Mr. Merricks writes (August 21) as a Special Member of
the Potato Marketing Board, and in that capacity he is well aware of
the reasons why it is necessary to have quota restrictions on the
planning of potatoes. To have violent fluctuations in the acreage,
and consequently in prices, serves the interest neither of producers
nor consumers, as was well shown in the years before the Board was set
up.
   <p>Of course it is not possible for the Board, by its quota
prescriptions, to plan for an exact acreage. There are too many
factors which affect farmers' own intentions for any quota laid down
by a Board, or by any other body, to do more than influence the
position. But the Board would surely be failing to carry out its
responsibilities if it did not exercise the powers conferred on it by
the Potato Marketing Scheme to assist growers to plan their production
from year to year at a level normally adequate to meet the consumers'
needs at reasonable prices.
   <p>Mr. Merricks is also aware that &pound;1m. a year from the
increased contributions would go to meet the Board's share of the
proposed market support fund and would attract twice that sum from the
Government. It would therefore get back to the producer in the form
of higher prices for his crop in surplus years and should thus
encourage greater stability in acreage and prices as between one year
and another. It is difficult to see how amendments to the Scheme
which produced this result could be described as <quote>harmful.</quote>

<head>Building Bricks</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; In reply to the article in THE FINANCIAL TIMES of
August 3 re building bricks, the Scottish brick works have about
40m. composition bricks in stock, made without the help of foreign
labour, and could produce more if need be.
   <p>There is a freight opening for British Railways, 120m. tons, if
the price were right.
   <p>Composition bricks are imported from Belgium and distributed to
various parts of England cheaper than the freight charge from Scotland
to the south.

<head>Letters to the Editor</head>
<head>The Airlines</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; With reference to your leading article of August 23, the
causes of airline troubles are surely simple to diagnose. In the long
haul category the operating cost of the U.S. big jets of just
under 2 cents per seat mile is no improvement on existing types. It
is not, therefore, possible to lower fares appreciably and so widen
the market with these aircraft.
   <p>Basically the same trouble also applies to regional operations
with the additional difficulty that the sectors are so short that the
aircraft cannot get down anywhere near to the best point on the
range-cost graph. These airlines have ordered aircraft which only get
down to the best position at 1,000 miles and in many cases the
airlines do not have a single European sector approaching this. At
300-400 miles it is off the graph at the bottom end resulting in costs
of 3, 4 and 5 cents a seat mile. If the turbine engine and propeller
had been configured differently, cost of 1.5 cents would have been
realised, perhaps 1.2 with prospects of 1 cent on the horizon.
   <p>So airlines have only themselves to blame if air does not secure
a bigger part of the apparently static common carrier market due in
turn to the growth of private carriers. Airlines must surely get back
to the principles of careful husbandry, and demand economic
progression in the new vehicles they order.

<head>Economies in Drugs</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; In the outpatient departments of many hospitals, the
habit survives of prescribing small quantities of drugs, bandages,
etc., which have to be collected at the hospital dispensary.
Frequently, the charge for these prescriptions is considerably higher
than the cost at which they can be bought at the chemists. In
addition, patients have often to wait a long time, up to two hours,
for the dispenser to prepare the prescription.
   <p>Issuing such small prescriptions, which of course were originally
free, in the hospital might have made sense when outpatients were
presumably paupers to whom a saving of a few pence was material, and
to whom time was of little value. To-day, the N.H.S., the
over-worked dispenser and last but not least the patient, who may lose
wages while waiting, would be better off if the latter were simply
instructed to obtain small quantities of simple supplies at the
chemists. It is, of course, not suggested that this method should be
applied to complicated special prescriptions on which the effort of
the hospital dispensary freed from petty orders could be concentrated.

<head>Cost of H.P.</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; I presume that Mr. G. H. Woolveridge's letter
(August 23) is written in his official capacity, and it is for this
reason that I do not think it should be allowed to pass without
comment.
   <p>Firstly, what does it cost a motor trader to assist in filling up
an H.P. form and posting it? Bearing in mind the profit he is
making on the sale of the car I would have thought that he would be
delighted to do the work for nothing, especially as he would be unable
to sell the car if the finance was not forthcoming. Secondly, the 10
per cent. he receives is excessive.
   <p>Thirdly, if business is on recourse, in what way does the finance
house share the risk?
   <p>Fourthly, in my opinion H.P. charges have gone up by 1 1/2
per cent. flat even though commission has gone down.
   <p>Fifthly, can Mr. Woolveridge publish the rebate scales used by
F.H.A. members and state that they adhere to them? I doubt it.
At least one F.H.A. member charges many &pound;s extra for early
settlement where no new business arises, and it is simply not true to
say that finance houses would lose money if they gave a bigger rebate
in such cases.
   <p>Sixthly, his penultimate paragraph suggests that banks when
offering personal loans have no paper work, no collecting and
recording of monthly instalments and do not have to make provision for
bad debts or make enquiries about the integrity and standing of their
customers.

<head>Polythene Bags</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; The rapid increase in the use of thin polythene film has
added another <quote>home hazard</quote> against which precautions should be
taken, in order to avoid accidents as a result of misuse of the
material. This applies particularly to children, in that they can
become suffocated if polythene bags are placed over their heads.
   <p>This Association through its Polythene Product Committee has
collaborated with the Ministry of Health and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents, in order to determine methods of publicising
both the dangers and the recommended preventive measures.
   <p>Polythene film has certain characteristics which make it an
excellent packaging material for a wide variety of applications. In
many forms, such as small bags, there is no need for any particular
precautions, but with larger bags and sheets, and in particular where
film is used as a cover for mattresses and pillows, the material
should not be left on the articles when they are in use. It is
realised that such bags, and also those used for the packaging of a
large number of garments, are useful in the home. If, therefore,
these bags are retained, in order to use them from time to time for
storage purposes, they should be kept out of the reach of children.
If, however, they are not required for storage purposes, it is the
recommendation of the film manufacturers, and the above mentioned
bodies, that they should be disposed of immediately out of the way of
children.

<head>Exports of Capital</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; It is evident that the succour provided by the
I.M.F. merely cancels some of our short-term liabilities to
foreign countries, transfers them to the I.M.F., but
correspondingly reduces the possibility of gold losses from British
reserves. Let us have no illusions about this <quote>Monte de
Pieta,</quote> and hope that the cold storage period will be long enough.
For the future, it is important that any move on the part of British
industry to establish factories in hard currency countries as a result
of the impetus set in motion by entry into the Common Market should
not constitute a further drain on reserves.

<head>THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; We are much indebted to The Times for publishing
yesterday, in full, the broadcast of the President of the United
States to his people &mdash; and to the world &mdash; an account of his recent
visit to Europe.
   <p>This address, and the President's Inaugural Speech, has brought a
voice and an authority to the councils of the Free World &mdash; and outside
it &mdash; that speaks in frank, clear, and unambiguous terms, enabling
those who hear and read to appreciate the dangers and the immense
issues involved. His language, more than that of any other, reminds
me of the great utterances of Sir Winston Churchill during &mdash; and
immediately after &mdash; the war.

<head>REPEATED INTERFERENCE</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Mr. Kelf-Cohen, in his letter to you published on June
6, criticizes the emergency resolution passed by the Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association's annual conference in regard to the
interference of the Government in the running of the undertakings of
the British Transport Commission. That resolution pointed out that
the present attitude of the Government precluded the possibility of an
integrated and coordinated transport system, which conference believed
to be essential to the economy of the country. In abandoning the
policy of integration, the Government had made it impossible for the
commission to pay its way.
   <p>In speaking to the resolution I quoted from the leading article
in The Times in connexion with the Government's proposals, which
article stated that: ~<quote>Disintegration is being carried too far. In
many respects there will be less integration than there was in the
1930s.</quote> The article added: <quote>The plan will put the railways in the
position of splendid isolation, except for pipelines, which is
commercially unrealistic. The railway boards should be put in a
reasonable position to provide interlinked and complementary
transport.</quote>
   <p>In spite of this <quote>commercially unrealistic</quote> position, Mr.
Kelf-Cohen alleges that each member of my association receives &pound;4 per
week in subsidy from the taxpayer, and apparently he has arrived at
this figure by dividing the total B.T.C. deficit by the number of
employees, and then debiting the whole of the deficit (including the
sums paid for interest and other commodities) against the employees.
The payment of proper remuneration is generally regarded as the
first charge on an industry: Mr. Kelf-Cohen appears to regard it
as the last charge.
   <p>Mr. Kelf-Cohen asks if the members of the association are now
prepared to give up &pound;4 per week, but does he know what he is really
asking? A junior clerk of 16 receives &pound;230 per annum: does
Mr. Kelf-Cohen expect him to work for him for &pound;22 per annum,
or a young man to return from the forces at the age of 20 and work for
him for &pound;162 per annum (&pound;370-&pound;208)?
   <p>It should be remembered that until the implementation of the
Guillebaud Report, under which railway rates of pay were based on the
principle of <quote>comparability</quote> with those of comparable employees in
other employments, railwaymen had worked for considerably debased
rates of pay, and it was they who had been providing the subsidy
necessary for the running of the railways which are necessary to the
economy of the country.
   <p>Yours faithfully,

<head>MATHEMATICS</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Several of your correspondents on this subject have put
forward the view that, over the passing years, there has been a
gradual increase in difficulty in university honours courses in
mathematics, and that their content is now less suitable for intending
schoolteachers than formerly. I believe these views to be incorrect.
   <p>It is true that there have been considerable changes over the
years in the character of the mathematics taught in British
universities, but this is to be expected of any living subject. The
main change has been a move away from the mathematical <quote>jugglery</quote>
referred to by one of your correspondents to a more logical study of
mathematical structures and ideas. The type of honours examination
question at present set is in fact easier, in that it demands less in
the way of memory and manipulative technique than the type of question
common 50 years ago. One would like to claim also that present-day
examination questions demand more in the way of understanding, but
this high ideal is not always attained.
   <p>Because of the use of special terminologies, the newer
mathematical subjects may be meaningless to teachers in the schools
(or even to some university mathematicians), but this does not
necessarily make them harder for the student. The present-day student
tackles with ease questions on abstract algebra or topology, for
example, but finds difficulty with questions on older disciplines such
as elliptic functions and spherical harmonies. None of these
subjects, old or new, has any direct application in the school
curriculum. Nevertheless, many of the newer subjects are likely to be
of more use to the intending school teacher than the older ones; this
is especially true of abstract algebra and set theory, which should
help to clarify his understanding of elementary mathematical and
logical processes and in this way should improve his skill as a
teacher.
   <p>In conclusion, although I believe that university courses have
benefited, and that students' lives have been made easier, by the
reduction in the demands on manipulative <quote>jugglery</quote>, the pendulum
should not be allowed to swing too far in the opposite direction.
There are certain basic mathematical techniques and methods which
should not be omitted from university courses, but which should form
part of the equipment of every mathematician.
   <p>Yours faithfully,
   <p>R. A. RANKIN.

<head>STATEMENT ON KENYA</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Lord Salisbury in his letter to you does not very
clearly define either whether he knows what the Secretary of State for
the Colonies actually meant when he said of Kenya: ~<quote>I am sure that
the right thing to do is to study the position and to take
constitutional advance at the pace that is appropriate to the economic
circumstances of the country</quote>, nor does Lord Salisbury say what he
himself thinks Mr. Macleod should have meant by these words.
   <p>Having just paid a visit to Kenya and having met and talked with
a cross-section of opinion there it is my firm conviction that the
economic and political stability of Kenya can best be safeguarded by
(1) releasing Mr. Kenyatta as soon as possible in the hope that this
will strengthen the Government now in office and lead to a settling of
present African unrest and (2) going forward to independence phased
towards the end of 1962 or the beginning of 1963. With this, I am
quite satisfied, White opinion in the great majority agrees.
   <p>To give independence overnight too quickly would be a disservice
to Kenya in general and to the future stability of the African
administration in particular.
   <p>On the other hand to wait too long cannot serve the economic or
political well-being of the country. It cannot help the White
population in Kenya and they accept this; and it will not enable the
African political leaders to control their followers.
   <p>Mr. Macleod has a difficult decision to make on timing. In the
interests of Kenya political leaders in Kenya, both British and
African, and political representatives in both Houses of Parliament at
Westminster should not read into his words more than there is. The
words seemed to me to express an open mind for future negotiations.
If all parties in Kenya can have such a mind then all will be well
and there will be a great future for the country in which European and
African will play a part.
   <p>Yours sincerely,
   <p>K. LEWIS.
   <p>House of Commons, June 8.
   <p>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Lord Salisbury, in his letter on June 8, wisely draws our
attention to the statement by the Secretary of State for the Colonies
on constitutional advance in Kenya. He finds satisfaction in the
apparent willingness of Mr. Macleod to tie constitutional advance to
the economic circumstances in Kenya.
   <p>The statement was no doubt not intended as a comprehensive
pronouncement on the conditions in which constitutional advance might
take place. Having said that, it must be made clear to every
interested person that the economic situation cannot, and must not, be
used as a brake on constitutional progress. The deteriorating
economic situation, serious as it is, is the result of political and
constitutional uncertainty, among other factors. The economic
condition of Kenya cannot finally recover until further constitutional
advance takes place; that is, until a responsible government with an
African Prime Minister and an African majority in the Council of
Ministers, with popular support, is in effective leadership of the
country.
   <p>We shall fail seriously again if we do not take note of the fact
that the majority of people in the country want political advancement
first and economic progress second. There are great issues to be
settled before full independence can come, and here <quote>the needs of all
the races</quote> must be faithfully considered. But his Excellency the
Governor was surely right in his speech at the opening of the present
session of the Legislative Council, when he clearly hinted that with
the encouraging formation of a Government under the Lancaster House
constitution, further steps in constitutional development are now
possible and probable.

<head>HOSPITAL DISPENSING</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; In providing information for your Special Correspondent
for his article on the shortage of hospital pharmacists in today's
edition of The Times I discussed many aspects of the problem.
   <p>I am disturbed to find that some remarks of mine are liable to be
misinterpreted and could be taken to refer in a derogatory fashion to
the ability of retail pharmacists to interpret correctly the
prescriptions written by hospital doctors. This was never my
intention and such an interpretation is possible because my remarks
were of necessity condensed.
   <p>What I intended to imply was that doctors often prefer not to be
used solely in a consultative capacity in recommending treatment for
patients to their general practitioners because they prefer to
prescribe such treatment themselves, to know that it has been supplied
and then to follow up their patients by seeing them again. This
situation can be realized by the use of E.C.10(H.P.) forms
written by hospital doctors and dispensed by retail pharmacists. It
falls down, however, when the patients fail to take their
prescriptions to the chemists and this does sometimes happen.
   <p>Yours faithfully,
   <p>G. BRYAN, Chief Pharmacist.
   <p>The Middlesex Hospital, W.1, June 5.
<head>SPAIN</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; May I, as one of the younger generation to whom Sir
Thomas Moore on June 7 addressed a lesson in Spanish history, be
permitted to comment on some of the points he raised?
   <p>Sir Thomas's history is clearly partial. He claims that in
1938-39 Spain was in convulsion and that Franco created order from
this chaos. But how did the chaos arise?

<text id=LOBB12>
<head>Overtones of Crisis</head>
   <p>WHATEVER magician's wand of economic recovery the CHANCELLOR
may flourish in the next few days, it is impossible not to feel that
the Government has come rather ill out of the preliminary skirmishes.
   <p>July is a traditional month for economic crises, and the
beginning of the period of seasonal weakness for sterling. In 1955,
1957 and 1961 it has also been the month in which the Government has
chosen to create a national sense of economic anxiety. In fact, this
time the recognition of the crisis comes surprisingly late, for
Britain's trading position deteriorated sharply last year, and is now
getting slightly better rather than worse.
   <p>The Government's propaganda may indeed have over-reached itself.
Undoubtedly the CHANCELLOR'S speeches, and the PRIME MINISTER'S blunt
warnings to the 1922 Committee, were intended to prepare the nation
and the Conservative Party for strong measures to put the economy
right. These warnings, however, have run too far ahead of action.
After so long a period of uncertainty we are left with a sense more
of emergency than of urgency.
   <p>Nor has this helped the national confidence. There is a growing
feeling that the economic crisis is only a symptom of a profounder
failure to find Britain's proper international position in the
post-war world. The delay in working out the new economic policies,
and in deciding on our European policy, has left an impression that
the Government does not itself know what to do.
   <p>Certainly there has been a lack of that sort of leadership which
inspires national unity. Current bickering about the surtax
concessions in the Budget evades the point. The Government is not to
be blamed for wanting a more dynamic economy with higher incentives,
but it has failed to explain to the nation any consistent and
practical policy to achieve expansion, and it has therefore failed to
carry the nation along with it.
   <p>The economic measures which are going to be introduced will need
to be tough, and must be judged primarily by their effectiveness; but
it is also very important that they should be fair. The mixture of
slow economic growth with financial <quote>get rich quick</quote> in recent
years has been wholly bad in its social effects. The sacrifices that
are now to be called for must be carried by the whole country and not
by any one section of it.
   <p>The general public, and the trade unions, will be the more
willing to accept the need for restraint, for earning first and buying
later, if they can see a clear objective which sacrifices will help to
achieve, and if those sacrifices fall as heavily on the private sector
as on the workers.
<head>Liking Yuri</head>
   <p>THE wave of goodwill that has accompanied Major Yuri Gagarin
has been remarkable, not least for its apparent detachment from
conventional Anglo-Soviet attitudes. After all, he arrived here hard
on the heels of Mr. Khrushchev's declaration that Russia must spend
substantially more on arms because the West was doing so, and of an
impressive and well-publicised display of Soviet air-power. These
were not ideal heralds.
   <p>Nor is his undoubted success entirely accountable in terms of his
personal charm, great though that is, nor of the presence of the
Russian Trade Fair.
   <p>What in fact Major Gagarin seems to have done is to have shown us
how much we want to like the Russians, in a spirit of genuine
neighbourliness.
   <p>This, and the fact that British visitors to Russia usually find a
reciprocal warmth of welcome there, is surely a portent worth noting
by the political leaders on both sides.
<head><squote>Giant</squote> of the Left</head>
   <p>MR. FRANK COUSINS'S success in maintaining the support of
his Transport and General Workers' Union for the lost-cause campaign
of unilateralism is a personal triumph, though it is fortunately
unlikely to affect Mr. Gaitskell's new firm control of his party.
   <p>But the Brighton conference at which he won a 3 to 1 victory is
important for other reasons. The extent of the personality cult which
has sprung up around Mr. Cousins astonished many observers. The
nadir came after the disarmament vote, when his principal opponent
unblushingly declared: <quote>I feel like a dwarf in the shadow of a great
man.</quote>
   <p>The big stick of the T.G.W.U., with its 1,250,000
well-disciplined members, is now held firmly in the Left hand of Mr.
Cousins. In the days of his distinguished predecessors, Ernest Bevin
and Arthur Deakin, the union was always inclined to the Right. It
seems that T.G.W.U. politics depend upon the personal views of
the man who heads its permanent machine. The majority trot
comfortably in the wake of the reigning <quote>giant.</quote>
   <p>It is a disturbing view of democracy.
<head>South Bank Puzzles</head>
   <p>THE non-party enterprise of the London County Council in
stimulating at least the possibility of action over the National
Theatre is wholly commendable. But it is clear from the latest
proposals that the problems involved have not been adequately thought
out; when the Council meets on Tuesday to consider the report of its
General Purposes Committee it will be faced with the raw material for
many hours' debate.
   <p>The suggestion that Sadler's Wells opera should join the National
Theatre on the South Bank entirely changes the whole picture. In a
statement to THE SUNDAY TIMES yesterday, reported elsewhere, Sir Isaac
Hayward said that it may be necessary to think of three auditoriums.
There is no question of <quote>may</quote>: such an extension will be quite
essential if the National Theatre is not to be reduced to a travesty
of what it should be.
   <p>In any case the whole building will have to be redesigned.
Perhaps this is no bad thing, for the existing plans are already
twelve years old. If the new proposals are accepted, the design of
the new building should be put up to open competition &mdash; and a building
might emerge at last of which Britain could be proud.
   <p>The Council might also think it wise to ask the Chancellor for a
clarification of his statement that his subsidy would be limited to
&pound;400,000: a statement that seems to take no account of the fact that
the new building cannot in any case be ready for at least three years,
nor allows for possible changes in the value of money.
<head>1,000th Refugee</head>
   <p>BRITAIN received last week her 1,000th refugee under the
scheme initiated by World Refugee Year in June, 1959. Of all the
refugees resettled since the first humanitarian impulse of the Year,
we have taken in almost one-third; more than any country in the world.
Most have come from the <quote>hard core</quote> of physically or socially
handicapped families rejected by almost every other State.
   <p>Public response did not drop after the end of the Year, and
places have already been found for the 100 or so refugees who are
still to come before the limit set by the Government is reached. But
what then? There are still 80,000 unsettled refugees in Europe.
   <p>Britain can be proud of the new impetus she has helped to give to
this essential task, but where many have shown charity, there have
also been apathy and intolerance. No doubt some refugee families have
shown ingratitude; have spurned the houses provided for them, or even
returned to their camps. But we cannot deny responsibility for the
mental as well as the physical condition of those left rootless for
sixteen years by a warring world. Until the last refugee is resettled
our obligations must remain.
<head>Tell the Patient</head>
   <p>MOST doctors will agree with the Minister of Health that
<quote>the patient and all concerned with him have the right to be treated
as intelligent persons.</quote> Most will say that they do tell the
patient all he should know about his condition. But, of course, they
will invariably add, when pressed, that there are others who are not
so forthcoming, so frank or thoughtful.
   <p>What Mr. Powell calls, in modern jargon, the failure of
communication is a fact of the medical service, particularly in
hospitals, that is not the fault of any small minority. It has
persisted into these frank-speaking days as a result of a professional
attitude, fostered and inculcated from one generation to the other as
a kind of mystique &mdash; or as a safeguard against being proved wrong.
   <p>It is usually justified on the grounds that <quote>a little
knowledge</quote> can be harmful. But, as the Minister says <quote>the failure
to speak two sentences can cause deep antagonism.</quote> Training in
communication should perhaps be included in the medical student's
curriculum.
<head>A Call to Unity</head>
   <p>THE British are a realistic people who do not always choose
to face reality. At present they are trying to avoid facing not one
but a number of crises with an almost desperate complacency. For a
few days, a nine-day wonder, it seemed that the economic crisis was
really penetrating the national consciousness. But by the end of last
week people were waiting for Tuesday with all their usual tepid
equanimity; even the Stock Exchange was edging upwards.
   <p>Yet at least the economic crisis made some impact. That was more
than could be said of the impending decision on the Common Market, and
certainly more than of the crisis of Berlin. The decision to be made
on joining Europe is possibly the most important Britain has had to
make since the war; yet no one could claim that the public debate has
been on a high level. So great is the apathy that the Government
could probably go in or stay out without vitally offending either its
own followers or the country.
   <p>The national awareness on Berlin is even more unawakened. This
is the gravest of the three crises, one on which the issue of peace or
war could turn. The British Government has from the beginning sought
a negotiated settlement, but has always accepted the basic decision
that the people of West Berlin cannot be abandoned. Yet the national
attitude seems almost to be that Berlin is not to be allowed to
interfere with the summer holidays.
   <p>This complacency is a poor basis for policy; and a poor
substitute for that sense of moral purpose for which the PRIME
MINISTER and the CHANCELLOR have appealed.
   <p>The economy, Berlin, the Common Market &mdash; here are three issues
whose gravity has during the past few days led to regretful sighings
over the impracticability of a National Government. The British
system has never taken kindly to government by Coalition, which is
certainly not the answer now; but almost as disturbing as the national
complacency is the apparent lack of any real sense of national unity.
<head>Party Views Not Far Apart</head>
   <p>YET even in the economic field, where the division is widest,
and where the Labour Party can most reasonably expect to reap
political credit, the judgment and sentiment of the party leaders are
not all that far apart. Mr. GAITSKELL'S speech last Tuesday was a
constructive and sensible contribution to the economic debate. On
Europe it seems almost certain that Mr. GAITSKELL would find himself
moving along the present line of policy if he were Prime Minister.
(He would be foolish to risk splitting his party in Opposition;
Governments have to make unpleasant choices, Oppositions can avoid
them.) On Berlin again the responsible Labour Party view and the
Conservative view are so close as to be indistinguishable.
   <p>There is therefore a genuine basis for unity, and many people in
the country would like that unity to be made apparent, for a
bi-partisan policy would undoubtedly strengthen British influence for
peace &mdash; an influence more necessary now than it has been for years.
At present the obstacles to a bi-partisan policy, at any rate over
Berlin, are partly personal &mdash; Mr. MACMILLAN and Mr. GAITSKELL have
never fought side by side as Lord ATTLEE and Sir WINSTON CHURCHILL did
in wartime. These differences need to be reconsidered.
   <p>Yet the greater weakness is perhaps the failure to waken the
British people. When great issues are shirked, little differences are
given more than their proper weight. The call to national unity and
the call for national leadership perhaps come in the end to much the
same thing.

<text id=LOBB13>
<head>Keep off the brink!</head>
   <p>WHAT exactly are the Americans up to? Have they actually
calculated all the consequences of what they are doing with their
tanks and planes in Berlin?
   <p>If so, what is the point of it all? Will these American moves
really strike the world as a sign of strength &mdash; or as a gesture of
weakness and frustration?
   <p>It is true that there is cause for frustration. With their
nuclear tests the Russians are behaving like lunatic children.
   <p>But that is no reason for the West to try being even more lunatic
and childish.
   <p>It is no reason for a policy of daring brinkmanship.
   <p>A single shell fired accidentally in Berlin by some unthinking
youth from Texas or the Ukraine could now destroy humanity quite as
inevitably as any 50-megaton bomb.
   <p>The British Government's urgent task is to stop the border
generals being bold and brave at mankind's expense.
<head>Call it off!</head>
   <p>CAN the Government possibly persist in its plans for the
royal tour of Ghana after the bomb explosions which have shaken Accra?
   <p>For weeks journalists and M.P.s have brought reports from
Ghana about possible violence during the Queen's visit.
   <p>But our Ministers have explained smugly that the facts provided
by their own experts show no cause for concern.
   <p>Well, what do they say now?
   <p>Are bombs not facts? Is an explosion on the very spot where the
Queen is due to stand this week not a cause for concern?
   <p>Did the Government's experts not warn that such things might
happen?
   <p>If they did, it is a terrible reflection on the Cabinet, which
concealed the warnings. If they did not, it is a sad reflection on
their experts.
   <p>Our Royal Family has always been ready to take risks for a good
purpose. But for what purpose are risks to be taken in Ghana?
   <p>Merely to bolster up a petty, tottering dictator.
   <p>It would be little short of criminal if any life were risked in
such a cause.
<head>The brave servant</head>
   <p>THERE can be nothing but the highest admiration for the
Queen's conduct in Ghana.
   <p>She knew the risk she was running in going there. She was aware
of the bombs and violence in that country recently.
   <p>She was aware too that during her ceremonial drive with Nkrumah
it would have been easy for an assassin's bullet to have struck the
wrong target.
   <p>And yet she has insisted on keeping her promise to the ordinary
people of Ghana. She has gone ahead with her tour.
   <p>Nothing could have been easier for her than to cancel this
venture. She merely had to tell her misgivings, in confidence, to the
Prime Minister. No one would have been surprised if the visit had
been cancelled. Everyone would have understood.
   <p>The Queen has shown many times before that she is a dedicated
and sincere servant of her people throughout the world. Now she has
displayed, as well, the highest form of courage in grave physical
danger.
<head>Wipe off his smile</head>
   <p>IN Essen tomorrow Herr Alfried Krupp will be celebrating
the 150th anniversary of the foundation of his mighty industrial
empire.
   <p>Who can blame him if he mixes homage to his ancestors with a
little sardonic amusement at the expense of the Allied Governments?
   <p>For if he had obeyed their instructions the Krupp empire would
have been broken up long ago. There would have been nothing to
celebrate.
   <p>But Krupp, the convicted war criminal, the employer of slave
labour, has succeeded year after year in getting an extension of his
<quote>promise</quote> to sell out his companies.
   <p>By one cunning dodge after another he has kept this one-time
power centre of German militarism intact.
   <p>It is a scandalous story.
   <p>How much longer is our Government going to be content with just a
mild squawk of protest when Krupp asks for yet another year's
reprieve?
<head>Answer this today</head>
   <p>COMMONWEALTH Governments are at last to see in full a
speech which Mr. Edward Heath made more than a month ago.
   <p>And why are they going to see it?
   <p>Not because it was on a question which vitally affects their
whole future &mdash; although it does.
   <p>Not because they are members of an association the first and most
precious principle of which is mutual trust.
   <p>Not because most of them, like the members of the United Kingdom
Cabinet, are loyal Ministers of the same Queen.
   <p>The only reason they are going to be allowed to see it is
because some obscure official somewhere in Europe has already leaked
the whole thing to another foreign Government.
   <p>But there is something even more shameful.
   <p>For in Brussels a Common Market spokesman indicates that the only
reason Commonwealth Governments were ever excluded from seeing whole
copies of the speech was because the British Government requested
it.
   <p>Can this really be true?
   <p>The nation demands an immediate answer from Mr. Harold
Macmillan.
<head>Lesson for a critic</head>
   <p>THE final curtain comes down on the tragic farce of O'Brien
in Africa.
   <p>Look at it again act by act.
   <p>Five months ago Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien came bouncing into the
Congo as a United Nations chief.
   <p>By UNO standards his qualifications were excellent.
   <p>He was known as an enemy of colonialism.
   <p>He had even coined a phrase for the colonialists whom he scorned
most. He called us <quote>the Brits.</quote>
   <p>He was typical of all those who believe that the representatives
of UNO must inevitably be more enlightened, decent, and
efficient.
   <p>Well, how has he done in Africa himself?
   <p>With his UNO team he has been responsible for more
bloodshed, intolerance and racial hatred than almost any other man in
recent African history.
   <p>As he looks at the mess he has left behind he must wonder how
<quote>the Brits</quote> so often managed to succeed in the kind of situation
where he has so dismally failed.
<head>Repeal it</head>
   <p>WATCH the workings of the deplorable Homicide Act of 1957.
   <p>Last week Edwin David Sims was found guilty of the horrible
killing of two Gravesend teenagers.
   <p>But under the new law this was not murder &mdash; because of his
<quote>diminished responsibility</quote>.
   <p>His crime &mdash; which everyone would unhesitatingly call murder &mdash;
will go down in the records as manslaughter.
   <p>It will help the experts to claim that the rise in the
murder-rate since the Homicide Act is not really serious.
   <p>And that is not all.
   <p>By the time this psychopath is in his early forties he will
probably be a free man. Free to roam the countryside once again.
   <p>Is it not a scandal that a law which allows this to happen should
remain on the Statute-book?
<head>Losers</head>
   <p>WHO would lose most if Britain decided not to join the
Common Market and so brought our trade with Europe largely to a
standstill?
   <p>The answer is: not the British.
   <p>If you want evidence of that look at the wrangle now going on in
Brussels over the Common Market tariffs.
   <p>The French say they must sell more wine in Germany. But the
Germans retort that wine must not flow only in one direction. If
Germany is to buy more, then France must take more from Germany.
   <p>The fact is, of course, that there is only one country in Europe
in which the French wine industry &mdash; on which the rural economy of
France depends &mdash; can sell in sufficient quantities. And that is
Britain.
   <p>What is true of wine is equally true of one industry after
another. If our leaders only had the courage we could trade with
Europe on our own terms.
   <p>For the <quote>Six</quote> have a much greater need of our market than we
have of theirs.
<head>Purpose</head>
   <p>FASHION is turning against the Christmas card. It is
argued that there is no purpose in posting a flood of cards often to
people you hardly know.
   <p>Yes, but not all the cards in that flood are without purpose.
   <p>To the old and the lonely a card is a wonderful reminder that
they are not forgotten.
   <p>And to the relation or neighbour you have quarrelled with it is
the most tactful peace offering of all.
<head>Finger on the trigger</head>
   <p>WHOSE finger is on the trigger?
   <p>Off to the United Nations forces in the Congo goes a load of
1,000lb. bombs sent with the compliments of the British taxpayer.
   <p>They go, the Government piously points out, on special terms
only.
   <p>On each bomb there is virtually a label saying: <quote>Not to be used
except against <squote>pirate</squote> planes and air-strips.</quote>
   <p>But can that really keep the Government's conscience clean?
   <p>Does it have any control over the Indian airmen who are going to
drop the bombs? Is there the slightest evidence that they either know
or care about our terms?
   <p>For all we know the men in charge of these operations may be just
as deluded and hysterical as their former chief, Conor O'Brien.
   <p>For all we know these British bombs may soon be crashing down on
hospitals and British missionaries.
   <p>No wonder the Tory rebels are in uproar. The only surprise is
that there should be a single Tory M.P. who is prepared to
support a decision which is both weak and wicked.
<head>Prigs</head>
   <p>THE nuclear disarmament rioters who have been causing so
much annoyance say that this is the only way in which they can stir
the nation's conscience.
   <p>Could anything be more priggish than that?
   <p>Do they seriously suppose that the rest of us are indifferent to
the risk of a nuclear war?
   <p>The truth is that their fellow-countrymen have not got less
conscience. Just more sense.
   <p>For suppose that these exhibitionists had got their way last
year. Suppose that both East and West had given up their nuclear
stocks.
   <p>Is it not certain that we would already be in the midst of the
most terrible conventional war in history over Berlin?
<head>Thrift</head>
   <p>THE Treasury is right to save money by clamping down on
embassy parties for the Queen's official birthday.
   <p>But the saving is only &pound;100,000 a year. Why stop there?
   <p>There is, for example, the &pound;18,000,000 in cash aid that we are
giving to Tanganyika.
   <p>There is the Congo which, through our backing for UNO, is
costing us around &pound;4,000,000 a year.
   <p>There is Mr. Nehru, who wants to squeeze about &pound;70,000,000 out
of us over the next two years.
   <p>And, of course, there is the Army on the Rhine. It is costing us
at least &pound;70,000,000 this year. And next year the bill may be near
&pound;100,000,000.
   <p>These fantastic sums are being squandered by vainglorious men
anxious for Britain to play a leading world role.
   <p>But they should remember this: true authority comes from
strength, not from pouring money down the drain.
<head>Wrong</head>
   <p>DO you remember the debtors prisons in the novels of
Charles Dickens?
   <p>Probably you associate them with the workhouse and with child
labour in the mines.
   <p>All the more amazing, then, that a century later our prisons
should still be crowded with debtors.
   <p>The cells should be reserved for criminals alone.
   <p>As for debtors, there will be fewer of them when business men
understand that, if you lend to someone whose credit is not good, then
you must be prepared to lose.
<head>Death for no reason</head>
   <p>AS the week-end began two British journalists were sending
this despatch while UNO bombers roared over Katanga: &mdash;

   <p><quote>A moment ago, in the foyer of the Leopold 2 Hotel, where we
are writing, they carried in a four-year-old girl. She was dead.
   <p><quote>In the moments it has taken to type this they have brought in
yet another child's body. The face is gone, the body shredded by
shell splinters.
   <p><quote>If you have seen broken dolls, you have some idea of the
picture.</quote>

   <p>Read those words again and ask yourself: Why were these little
children killed? What was their crime?
   <p>Was it because &mdash; as with Nazi Germany &mdash; their country was making
war on the world?
   <p>No. All it wanted was to be left alone.
   <p>Was it because their country was employing white officers?
   <p>No. Every other African State has whites in top positions. Even
the Indian airmen who killed them were white-trained.

<text id=LOBB14>
<head><squote>A tax on invalids! It is shameful that such a levy should be
collected by a Ministry of Health... worse still there is a tax on

<head>Let's give the Welfare State a shot in the arm</head>
<head>By KENNETH BARRETT</head>

   <p>INCREASED National Health charges. A further conjuring trick
with National Insurance contributions. The Minister of Health's
announcement the other day of changes to take place in April was a
signpost on the road of retreat from the first vision of nationwide
personal security.
   <p>There have been other signs of this retreat over the years. To
many of us it has long been evident that the Welfare State was in
danger of destruction from within.
   <p>First of all, the administrators have muddled one of the main
issues.
   <p>They have been determined to uphold a meaningless fiction. They
have insisted that part of the National Insurance stamp should go
towards the cost of the National Health Service.
   <p>This has deepened the widest-spread fallacy in the community &mdash;
the mistaken idea that the man who buys his National Insurance stamp
pays for the National Health Service. He doesn't, of course.
   <p>The total cost of the National Health Service in this financial
year will be about &pound;867,000,000. Of that vast sum, &pound;663,000,000
comes from general taxation, not from National Insurance stamps.
<head>Confused</head>
   <p>Small wonder that the man-in-the-street is confused.
   <p>Because the existence of the stamp as a source of supplementary
revenue to the National Health Service is a temptation to the
administrator in search of the appearance of economy.
   <p>It gives him a chance to make the Health Service look as if it
costs less.
   <p>Today the employed man pays 9s 11d. a week towards the whole
bill of social security in his weekly stamp. Of that, 1s 10 1/2d.
is earmarked for the health service.
   <p>In April he will, as a basis, pay 9s 9d. a week and the same
amount of 1s. 10 1/2d. will go to the health service.
   <p>At the same time, from April, he will have to pay, if his wages
are high enough an additional contribution to the State's massively
confusing graduated pension scheme, unless his employer <quote>contracts
out.</quote>
   <p>If he is earning &pound;15 a week, he will be paying, in all
probability, 5s. 1d. a week towards the graduated scheme.
   <p>The Minister of Health's proposals will alter the position again
in July.
   <p>His total basic contribution will be 10s. 7d.
   <p>Of this a larger proportion, 2s. 8 1/2d. this time, will be
earmarked for the health service.
   <p>With the highest contribution to the graduated scheme, his
stamp will cost him 15s. 8d.
   <p>Don't think for one moment that it's going to stop there.
   <p>Higher pensions will be sought. The health service will cost
more. The contributions, total and fraction, will all go up again.
   <p>The mere cost of the complex administrative tasks involved in
recording contributions is vast in proportion to the amount of tax
that is collected.
   <p>Yet the tempting fiction of the stamp will always be there.
<head>Enemy</head>
   <p>But the health service has another inside enemy.
   <p>It is, of course, on the face of things, reasonable to charge
people a little when they get some special extra benefit.
   <p>Why shouldn't the ordinary citizen, in an age of high wages,
pay some proportion of the cost of dentures or of spectacles?
   <p>That's the question. Why shouldn't the special beneficiaries
pay a little extra out of their own pockets?
   <p>It's an insidious argument. It seems so reasonable. But once
you start agreeing that the proposal is reasonable, you can reach the
extreme lengths of unreason.
   <p>For example, a well-paid patient, whose firm still continues his
wages, who draws sickness benefit on top, may have surgical and
hospital treatment costing many hundreds of pounds. And if he needs
spectacles, when in hospital, he gets them free.
   <p>And yet a widow, whose pension, for which her husband paid, is
wiped out because she works for a living wage, will now have to pay
12s. 6d. for each lens in her spectacles, and 17s. 8d. for the
frames. This is what the Minister proposes.
   <p>The truth is that you can't make sense out of small private
charges under a vastly expensive public scheme.
   <p>You can only alter the shape of the national bill.
   <p>But, at least, it ought to be a Minister's duty to refrain from
doing positive harm just to collect a token tribute to the total
tally.
   <p>And social harm, I fear, is what two of the proposed changes are
going to achieve.
   <p>For example, from March 1, each item on a National Health Service
prescription is to cost 2s.
<head>Children</head>
   <p>I leave out of account, for the moment, the estimate which I
have been given &mdash; that nearly one-third of such items cost less
than 2s.
   <p>I am thinking of the marginally poor, who happen to be in
constant ill-health. There are countless thousands of them.
   <p>The retired folk, getting on in years, with their retirement
pensions and &pound;3 or so a week from their old firms.
   <p>The man who, in protracted illness, receives half-pay from his
firm. The Army officer's widow. I could go on indefinitely.
   <p>They may need half a dozen prescribed items a week, easily.
Twelve shillings a week. A tax on invalids.
   <p>It is shameful that such a levy should be collected by a
Minister of Health.
   <p>Worse still. There is the tax on childhood. Pregnancy, like
death, is democratic.
   <p>The last war forced the state to protect the health of children
through the Maternity Clinic.
   <p>With the help of the National Health Service it has become a
possession beyond price.
   <p>All mothers go there. The solicitor's wife, the schoolmaster's
wife, the clerk's wife, the plumber's wife, and the wife of the chap
who is doing a stretch in gaol.
   <p>Never has the health of children been better. Never has
infantile mortality been so low.
   <p>And one of the reasons was that it cost nothing, or very little,
to take advantage of everything the clinic had to offer.
   <p>From June 1, instead of paying 5d. for the bottle of orange
juice and getting a free supply of vitamin tablets and cod liver oil,
there are to be higher charges.
   <p>The orange juice will be 1s. 6d., the cod liver oil 1s.,
and the tablets 6d. a packet.
   <p>These sums might have been deliberately fixed to keep the poorest
sort of mother away. And it will be the child that suffers in health.
   <p>By these particularly petty tactics, the Minister will save
&pound;1,500,000 out of the &pound;800,000,000 and more that we have to pay.
   <p>I have been very close to the crises, the challenge, the hopes,
needs, and anomalies of the Welfare State. And I think the time has
come to take a close look at what is going wrong.
<head>SLASH THIS HEALTH SERVICE RED TAPE</head>

   <p>YOU will have noticed the fierce House of Commons rumpus over
the proposed Health Service changes and charges. I gave my views in
detail about these last Sunday. It seems from the size and shape of
my mail that most of you agree with me.
   <p>Over the debate in the House the other day brooded the shadow of
the late Nye Bevan. He was the architect of the Health Service.
   <p>The Act of 1946 defines his vision. It gives the Health
Minister the duty of establishing <quote>a comprehensive Health Service to
secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the people...
and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness.</quote>
   <p>To the creators of the service there was no hesitation about one
further principle. It was to be free.
   <p>How far have these great objectives been achieved?
   <p>There are no longer two standards of medical treatment, one for
those who can afford it and another for those who can't.
<head>DOCTOR'S MERCY</head>
   <p>No longer does a deduction from the wages of the lower-paid
worker simply cover him during sickness, leaving his wife and children
to the mercy of the family purse or the doctor's kindness.
   <p>No longer is there a patchwork of clubs and voluntary
associations seeking to ensure some kind of medical treatment for
those who were not <quote>on the panel.</quote>
   <p>Of course, there were ominous rumblings at the start. The best
people, it was passionately argued, would still prefer to pay their
own doctors.
   <p>The best doctors, it was alleged, would stay resentfully out of
the National Service, refusing to become the minions of a Minister.
   <p>All these were myths created by prejudice. Within three months
of the appointed day under the Act, 39,000,000 were on Health Service
lists.
   <p>It is officially estimated today that 97 per cent of Britain's
inhabitants are using the Health Service.
   <p>Only 600 doctors engage wholly in private practice.
   <p>This is indeed a success story. But it is my task to look
critically and constructively at the flaws and the failures.
   <p>There is, in my mind, no doubt about the first mistake. The
nationalised industry of medicine presents a stupendous administrative
challenge.
   <p>It is now so complicated that the prime purpose of it all, the
prevention of ill-health, the welfare and re-assurance of the sick,
can disappear in the difficulties of departmentalism.
   <p>Today, Regional Hospital Boards plan hospital and consultant
services. Management committees administer hospitals at local level.
Executive councils are responsible for the general practitioner, the
dentist, the supply of drugs.
   <p>The local health authority looks after maternity services, child
welfare, the visiting midwife, the health visitor, the home help and
the ambulances.
<head>MINISTER'S JUNGLE</head>
   <p>Somewhere up at the top of this jungle the Minister of Health
is supposed to keep an eye on it all.
   <p>No wonder he can't see the wood for the trees.
   <p>The hospital service, the general medical service, the local
authority, each tends to work in isolation.
   <p>The family doctor is not encouraged to study his patient in
hospital.
   <p>Often there is no follow-up system from the hospital to the home,
or, if there is one, it doesn't work.
   <p>Each service washes its hands of responsibility when it passes a
patient to another branch of the system of National Health.
   <p>These divisions can rise to ludicrous levels. An ambulance will
take a patient to a hospital which can't admit him but, quoting the
correct rules, will refuse to drive him to a hospital which can treat
and cure him.
   <p>The costs of each section of the Health Service are scrutinised
as though they were isolated problems. Of course, they are all
interdependent.
   <p>Busier and better general practitioners in one area can reduce
the financial burden on the local hospital.
   <p>More money spent on local authority dental services when the
children are at school keeps down the bill of the general dental
service when they are grown up.
   <p>A rise in prescription costs may mean a shorter period of
sickness.
   <p>To take one illustration. Hospitals are given a certain amount
of money to spend in any one financial year.
   <p>They can't save any of it up and spend a little more in the
following year.
   <p>During the last month or two, therefore, of the arbitrary annual
accountancy, there is a mad rush to spend anything left in the kitty.
   <p>A National Health Service is bound to be expensive. It deserves
to be so if it works.
   <p>We still spend less than 4 per cent of the national income on
keeping people well and treating them when sick. I don't call that
unreasonable.
   <p>The cost of prescriptions is a topical problem. Here is an
ever-rising and very significant part of the bill. Let's look at it.
It has more than doubled since the service started.
   <p>Last year 214,000,000 National Health Service prescriptions were
made up. Goodness knows how many unidentifiable pills linger in
bathroom cabinets and how many bottles of cough linctus were emptied
down the sink after the first distasteful dose.
   <p>Five prescriptions a head last year, for everyone in the United
Kingdom at nearly 7s. a go!
   <p>The bill still goes up. Not primarily because doctors prescribe
more, but because drugs cost more.

<head>Two sides to the closing door</head>
<head>By COLIN LEGUM, Our Commonwealth Correspondent</head>

   <p>THE Government is going to have a hard job defending its
intention to change Britain's traditional <quote>open door</quote> policy for
Commonwealth citizens &mdash; a policy that goes back to 1608, when Lord
Chief Justice Ellesmere declared that James 1 was <quote>one entire king
over all his subjects in whichsoever of his dominions they were
born.</quote>
   <p>Of Britain's right to change this policy there can be no
question: she is the only Commonwealth member who has not so far acted
under the 1918 Imperial Conference decision giving each member
<quote>complete control of the composition of its population by means of
restrictions on immigration.</quote> The question is not, therefore, about
her right to make this change, but whether it is wise.
   <p>Nobody tries to deny that the problem of immigration into Britain
is primarily a problem of colour: the need for control was never
raised so long as immigrants were largely European, as, until
recently, they were. A nauseous campaign waged by a group of Tory
M.P.'s has been directed almost exclusively against coloured
immigration; and it is unfortunate that the Home Secretary waited to
make his formal announcement until the end of an unpleasant (though by
no means one-sided) debate at the Conservative Party Conference at
Brighton. Hence the need to disentangle the facts from the racial
prejudices which have obscured them.
<head>Voluntary control</head>
   <p>What are the facts? Until 1953 immigration from the
Commonwealth was negligible; and the permanent coloured population was
less than 50,000. The largest intake was from the West Indies,
running at about 2,000 a year. The one exception were the Irish: the
citizens of the Republic were treated for purposes of migration as if
they were Commonwealth citizens. Between 1945 and 1959 Irish
immigrants (353,000) exceeded immigrants (333,000) from all other
Commonwealth countries.
   <p>The great wave of West Indians started in 1954 with 10,000
immigrants; by 1960 the figure had risen to more than 54,000; and the
estimated figure for this year is likely to reach 70,000. This great
increase is due to fear of immigration controls. There are now about
200,000 West Indians (mainly Jamaicans) in Britain.
   <p>There is, however, another factor which weighed perhaps more
heavily with the Government's decision to introduce some form of
control. In the past the Governments of both India and Pakistan
voluntarily agreed to maintain strict control over emigration to
Britain. This system worked well until last year. The net inward
movement of Indians never exceeded 6,600; in 1959 it was down to
2,900. In the first eight months of this year, however, it reached
13,500.
   <p>For Pakistan, the highest figure was 5,200 in 1957, which dropped
to 2,500 in 1960. But in the first eight months of this year it rose
sharply to 13,160. Clearly, the control systems operated by India and
Pakistan have broken down.
   <p>It is difficult to find exact figures of non-coloured immigrants
because many people from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South
Africa are in fact emigrants returning home. But, with the exception
of the Irish, they are a negligible proportion of the total figure.
Non-Commonwealth immigrants (mainly Europeans on restricted work
permits) rose from about 45,800 in 1959 to just over 53,000 last year.
<head>Public services</head>
   <p>What conclusions can be drawn from these figures? There is
first the overall picture of an expanding working population, with
immigration accelerating, emigration decelerating (230,000 in 1957,
about 130,000 in 1960), and very little unemployment. Immigrants
starting new jobs totalled 177,500 in 1959, and 236,000 in 1960.
   <p>Immigration has therefore been meeting a real need; without it
British industry could not have expanded as fast as it has done. As
Mr. Butler stressed last week, London transport and hospitals would
have been in poor shape but for the immigrants, especially the West
Indians. The same is true of many public services, particularly in
the Midlands and Liverpool.
   <p>But there are clearly other factors which must be considered. As
things stand, there is no evidence that immigration will slow down of
its own volition. The reality of the world to-day is of unequal
economic development, with the richer countries growing richer and the
poorer being forced to export their unemployed. Within the
Commonwealth all other countries control immigration. The West Indian
islands even discriminate against one another. The older Dominions
(especially Australia) discriminate against non-whites. The United
States and Latin America have also recently tightened up their
immigration controls. This is no reason for Britain to behave
likewise, but it does raise the problem of what will happen if Britain
remains the only uncontrolled area into which the spill-over can go.
   <p>Is it right to assume that the volume of this spill-over should
be allowed to find its own level without any attempt at planning?
Will immigration slow down once the British employment market begins
to reach saturation point? Or shall we suddenly wake up to find that
failure of plan has produced a large surplus of unskilled and
semi-skilled labour, largely among the coloured communities? What
would result from such a lack of foresight?
<head>Real problems</head>
   <p>If undiminished West Indian immigration is now to be matched by
a rising tide of East Indian immigration (after the breakdown of the
voluntary system of controls), can we believe that racial and social
tensions will not be increased? And who would benefit from this?
   <p>Even though the real problems have become obscured by the
deplorable arguments of racists, it remains true that they are real
problems, and can be dealt with most effectively by rational
discussion.
   <p>Mr. Butler has firmly rejected the idea of any controls based
on discrimination. He has made the reasonable suggestion that people
with criminal records should not be allowed free entry, and that
immigrants with bad criminal records in this country might be
deported. He has also suggested that it might be desirable to relate
immigration to employment opportunities here.
   <p>There can be no real objection to these proposals, in principle.
What should concern us is how this policy is to be administered, and
whether in fact it can be administered without racial discrimination.
Since the majority of immigrants to-day are coloured, it will be
difficult to avoid the suspicion of discrimination.
   <p>It is vital therefore that, before any form of control is
introduced, Britain should consult all her partners in the
Commonwealth, and possibly her future allies in the Common Market as
well. For it is not only a question of deciding how best to arrange
for immigration to continue into Britain; it is equally important to
explore the possibility of greater migration within the Commonwealth
itself. Trinidad, Australia and Canada might all be expected to make
a greater contribution than they have done in the past.
   <p>Finally, there is the central question whether Britain will not
somehow be altering the whole nature of her relationship with the rest
of the Commonwealth if she abandons her <quote>open door</quote> policy. We
should not pretend that Britain has somehow been behaving in a way
worthy of special praise. Our own economy has benefited enormously
from immigration.
   <p>Nor must we think of ourselves as being uniquely generous.
France has always maintained an <quote>open door</quote> policy for members of
her Community &mdash; a policy much more difficult to maintain during the
Algerian troubles than anything we have so far had to face. Holland,
too, has kept open house for her associated territories.
   <p>Also we must remember that even if the coloured immigrants in
this country should reach 500,000 in the next year or two, they would
comprise only 1 per cent. of our total population. To shirk from
the implications of trying to integrate this tiny minority of coloured
peoples into British society is to show little confidence in our own
ability to practise what we always preach.
<head>Danger-spots</head>
   <p>But the problem of absorbing immigrants harmoniously into
British society is as important to the immigrants as to the British.
One of the important conclusions reached by Mr. James Wickenden in
his valuable study on <quote>Colour in Britain</quote> is that a danger appears
to lie <quote>where a concentration of immigrants has formed too quickly
for an area's capacity to absorb them. Where this occurs there has
been violence and the danger of violence and hostility will always be
present. As a short term measure it is therefore surely desirable to
keep the number of immigrants to a level which can be absorbed.</quote>
   <p>The <quote>open door</quote> policy is of value only so long as genuine
hospitality and security can be offered to the newcomers. It is with
this aspect that we should be mainly concerned.
<head>RUSSIA TO-DAY</head>
<head>by Edward Crankshaw</head>
<head>WHY MR. K IS OUT OF DATE</head>

   <p>In twenty years Russia may well achieve the prosperity promised
in the new party programme, but the Russian people are not likely to
be satisfied with material progress alone.
   <p>WHAT Mr. Khrushchev was talking about in the Kremlin last
Wednesday was 1984. He was looking twenty years ahead. But the
picture he painted &mdash; a picture which, he said, many people would
dismiss as Utopian &mdash; was not in the least Orwellian; and for this we
should be thankful. It was not Utopian either. It was, rather, a
picture of Metroland in 1961, extended to cover the vastness of the
Soviet Union. That Mr. Khrushchev should be able to think of it in
the same breath as Utopia is itself a sign that he is hopelessly
behind the times, not only in relation to the world as a whole but,
more interestingly, in relation to his own people.
   <p>He was introducing the new Party Programme to the Twenty-second
Party Congress, convened to approve his development plans for the next
two decades. Twenty years is a long time: Mr. Khrushchev will be
eighty-seven if he lives to see his Utopia come true. And if there is
one certain thing about this programme, it is that long before the
material promises are realised the whole concept will have become
irrelevant, overtaken by events; or, to use Mr. Khrushchev's own
favourite expression, life itself will have shown up the startling
insufficiencies of his present thinking.
<head>Air of triumph</head>
   <p>This is not to say that there will not be great material
advances, or that these are not necessary. Indeed, they are highly
necessary if the Soviet Union is ever to stand comparison with the
advanced nations of the West. For the West is also moving, and a
great deal will happen in the next twenty years.
   <p>Whether because Mr. Khrushchev is ignorant of the social
revolution in, for example, Britain, or whether because he thinks we
shall stand still, or collapse, Mr. Khrushchev seems incapable of
visualising any forward movement outside the Soviet Union. He says,
for example, with an air of triumph, that within the next two decades
every family in the Soviet Union will have a comfortable apartment to
itself: is it inconceivable that this may also happen here?
Apparently unaware that British agricultural labourers get holidays
with pay, pensions, and benefits under the health services, he
announces that paid holidays will <quote>gradually be extended</quote> to farm
workers, who are also, some time in the next two decades, to receive
old-age pensions and sickness and temporary disability grants.
   <p>With regard to education, he said that <quote>about 40 per cent. of
the country's workers and over 23 per cent. of its farm workers</quote>
now have a secondary or higher education: by 1981 all children are to
receive a complete secondary education. During the same period the
goal of free medical treatment and hospitalisation for all, as well as
free rents, will be reached.
   <p>All this, with a reduction of working hours, is designed to bring
about in the next twenty years <quote>a living standard higher than that of
any capitalist country.</quote> For the first time in history, Mr.
Khrushchev said, insufficiency would be fully and finally eliminated:
no capitalist country, he asserted, could set itself this task. But
he adduced no evidence to support either of these statements.
<head>Productivity only</head>
   <p>It is one thing to congratulate Mr. Khrushchev on breaking
down the Stalinist paralysis (somebody had to do it) and setting the
Soviet Union on the road to material prosperity after the negative
horrors of the cruel years.

<head>Letters to the Editor</head>
<head>Defier of Lenin</head>
   <p>SIR &mdash; Prof. Seton-Watson used my father's name in his
article on Persia last Sunday, meaning a man who would pave the way
for the Communists. When the uninstructed speak like that, one takes
it from whence it comes, but from Prof Seton-Watson...
   <p>In 1917 the Bolsheviks were not yet known to be totalitarians and
a great proportion of Russian Socialists were not prepared to fight
them with the gloves off, but Kerensky was. He was <quote>promoted</quote> to
the premiership because he did not regard the Bolsheviks as <quote>old
comrades</quote> and could overcome the hesitations of Socialist leaders
when it came to stern measures against them.
   <p>During the summer of 1917 he dispersed a Communist rebellion with
a whiff of grapeshot now described by such <quote>progressive</quote> historians
as A. J. P. Taylor as a <quote>massacre.</quote>
   <p>It was a blundering general, with the active encouragement of the
English and the French, who destroyed Russian democracy by attempting
a right-wing putsch, which was suppressed without a shot but
left the masses confused and distrustful of Kerensky.
   <p>This turn of events enabled Lenin to mount a counter-attack which
the vast majority of Socialists &mdash; tantamount to a majority of the
nation &mdash; resisted only with talk. Kerensky collected a large enough
army to defeat them, but the troops fell for the siren song of
<quote>peaceful co-existence</quote> and that was that.
   <p>The darlings of democracy today are the men who, long after the
Communists have shown their true colours, have handed country after
country to them: Benes surrendering Czechoslovakia, Roosevelt giving
them half of Europe, Truman and Attlee abandoning China to its <quote>mild
agrarian reformers.</quote>
   <p>Might I suggest that <quote>Moscow</quote> knows that Kerensky has been one
of its most unhesitating and determined enemies for 44 years, and what
it is really looking for in Persia is not Kerensky (nor
Mikhailovich, nor Chiang) but a nice Western-style statesman with
half-a-round-table-full of crypto-Communist advisers?
   <p>Southport, GLEB KERENSKY.
   <p>&ast;&ast;&ast; Alexander Kerensky, Prime Minister of Russia between the
fall of the Tsars and the rise of the Bolsheviks, is now 80. He lives
in California, where he is engaged in research and lecturing in
Russian history at Stanford University.
   <p>
   <p>Sir &mdash; My article, <quote>Russia's Southern Doorstep,</quote> had to be
condensed for reasons of space, and in the process a slight but
important change occurred. It reads: <quote>In so far as the United
States has hitherto been the protector of the r&eacute;gime, the people
tend to be emotionally anti-Western....</quote>
   <p>What I had written was: <quote>...the opposition tend to be
emotionally anti-Western.</quote>
   <p>What proportion of the people belongs to <quote>the opposition</quote> is a
matter of opinion. There can be no doubt that there are millions of
Persians who are devoted to the Shah, and have no hostility to the
West.

   <p>
   <p>One look at the University newspaper would show how largely the
discussion of religion and politics figures in the student's life
here.
   <p>We personally were attracted by the friendly, unbiased atmosphere
of the Anglican Society, where free, intelligent discussion is a
normal practice. Jazz Club is popular because it is the only weekly
social occasion which gives one the opportunity of meeting one's
fellow students en masse.
   <p>Among our acquaintances at the corporate communion mentioned by
<quote>Inquirer,</quote> very few were not present at Jazz Club the previous
evening. Jazz does not exclude religion. &mdash; Elizabeth A. Bunn;

   <p>It is true that many students have little or no religious
ideals and standards.
   <p>But as members of the Southampton Catholic Society, we can assure
you of the existence of a very strong body of regular church-goers who
also take an active part in many other branches of University life. &mdash;

   <p>
   <p>What an odd University Southampton must be!
   <p>When I went to the University sermon in the University church
here, St. George's, Bloomsbury, on April 30, advertised as at 8.0
p.m., I found the church packed, and had to wriggle my round
 to an obscure seat at the side.
   <p>If you want to be certain of a seat at the London University
sermon, you have to go to Evensong first.
   <p>The sermon was about Pascal, no doubt an interesting modern
person: but nobody knew that beforehand. &mdash; Margaret Deanesly,

<head>Rotten potatoes</head>
   <p>Sir &mdash; It seems to me that Mr. Rennie, Chairman of the Potato
Marketing Board, stands condemned out of his own mouth.
   <p>His first letter stated that no significant quantity of
potatoes sold to the board had been left to rot in clamps and that in
general they had removed such stocks before deterioration
prevented their use. Having spent public money on these potatoes was
it not his inspectors' duty to ensure that they were sold before they
deteriorated?
   <p>It was also widely reported in the Press that 2 1/2d. per lb
was the producers' price and 5d. a lb the retail price. Mr.
Rennie did not query the figure until you published it.
   <p>But the most surprising of all his statements must be that <quote>the
question of compensation for deterioration does not arise as the
potatoes remain the property of the farmer until loading instructions
are given.</quote>
   <p>In that case why were farmers not allowed by the Board to load
potatoes when asked for them by merchants? Farmers who sought
permission to cancel their contracts and sell to merchants were
refused by the Board.
   <p>How can the Board buy potatoes under contract and not own them?

   <p>Sir &mdash; Would it not be possible slightly to change the date of

by the azaleas and the rhododendrons? They are not a typically
British feature, and I cannot help feeling that the organisers of this

popular and more subtle.

<head>Irish Partition</head>
   <p>Sir &mdash; Perhaps your comments on Northern Ireland last Sunday
could be put in a wider context.
   <p>Surely people nowadays are aware of the benefits (particularly
economic) of integration, association, and federation.
   <p>Cyprus &mdash; where differences between the two communities are surely
as strong as any in Ireland &mdash; has shown that it is possible to unite
an island and to safeguard the interests of a large minority.
   <p>In Ireland it seems that Catholics are now tolerated north of the
border in such positions as shop stewards in the shipbuilding
industry; perhaps religious passions are cooling a little at last.
Certainly it might be argued that the political and economic division
of Ireland perpetuates traditional animosities which are now largely
irrelevant.
   <p>Perhaps a more integrated Ireland would be feasible within the
wider framework of the Commonwealth or the Common Market.

   <p>The Consumers' Advisory Council is at present consulting various

both manufacturer and shopper. We are also preparing a comparison

   <p>It would help over both these projects if your readers would tell
us if they have ever suffered injury or damage from a defect in goods
they have bought, and been unable to claim compensation from the

   <p>I agree with him that it depends on the individual. The thing
one has to remember is that the faster one goes the greater is the

   <p>At the age of 77 I myself am still driving fast sports cars. I
run a 300 S.L. Mercedes in which I have done 153 m.p.h. and
also a 135 m.p.h. Aston Martin. I claim that in spite of my age
it is certainly not necessary for me to give up these exciting cars.
   <p>But then I used to be a racing driver and I have been driving
these cars all my life. This is the main point really.

<head>Self-Criticism</head>
   <p>Sir &mdash; You may print what you like in your entertaining Sunday
paper, but please don't print inaccurate statements about films.
   <p>On page 28 last Sunday you reported that the film <quote>Rosen Fu"r
Den Staatsanwalt</quote> (the correct title of which is, incidentally,
<quote>Roses for the Prosecutor</quote>) is of East German origin.
   <p>The film was made in Western Germany, although it is true that
the director, Wolfgang Staudte, has worked for the East German
DEFA, and therefore, in some eyes, may be politically
suspect.
   <p><quote>Roses for the Prosecutor</quote> is merely one of many new West
German productions, which, like <quote>The Girl Rosemarie,</quote> take a tilt
at their Establishment &mdash; a very healthy sign in German films in view
of their 1933-1945 productions.

<head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</head>
<head>When MPs Go Abroad</head>
   <p>SIR &mdash; The article by your political correspondent, Mr.
Ian Waller, drawing attention to the concern over MPs' sponsored
trips abroad, raises an issue that has been avoided for years.
   <p>The plain fact is that it is extremely difficult for MPs to
accept invitations from foreign Governments, or from public relations
organisations working for them, without being compromised.
   <p>In any case, you tend to become inhibited or you have to be very
thick-skinned to the point of rudeness. And if you end up taking the
opposing view to the one you are supposed to have taken, it cannot
help but leave bad blood.
   <p>As someone who has travelled fairly extensively in recent years,
since I became a Member of Parliament, I have reluctantly come to the
conclusion, after experience, that it is usually better not to go on
sponsored trips rather than face invidious difficulties.
   <p>Thus I have declined a number of invitations from foreign
Governments and have only gone when I have been able to <quote>work my
passage,</quote> usually with my pen. But I am very fortunate in being a
professional journalist.
   <p>The existing parliamentary bodies arranging trips abroad, like
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, do not always meet the need.
   <p>What, then, is the answer? I believe that the best solution
probably is to make available to every MP an overall foreign
travel allowance which he has to use (if he wants it) within the
lifetime of a single Parliament, either in one or two major journeys
or in a series of short ones.
   <p>Only in this way can we hope to enable the House of Commons to
have independent, first-hand impressions of many problems affecting
this country and on which our Parliament has on occasion to make major
decisions.
   <p>DESMOND DONNELLY.
   <p>House of Commons.
   <p>
   <p>Sir &mdash; Of course there are rogues in Parliament, but no more than
one would find in commerce, the Church, or even the Press. Without
being pious about it I know of no MPs who would allow their
parliamentary activities to be influenced by a 10-day trip to East
Germany, Central Africa, or anywhere else.

<text id=LOBB17>
<head>Russia's new plans</head>
   <p>In the light of post-war history, which reached its tragic
climax with the Russian betrayal of the attempts at Geneva to reach
agreement on atomic disarmament, there must be some excuse for the
coldness of the reception which has so far been accorded to the latest
Soviet proposals for settling the status of West Berlin before Russia
signs a peace treaty with East Germany. According to a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Paris, there have been no official
communications or conversations between the Soviet leaders and the
Western ambassadors, with the exception of Dr. Kroll, the West
German Ambassador. Nevertheless, the proposals which were made public
yesterday do seem to serve as a basis upon which to resume
discussions: and they make an important concession.
   <p>This is the willingness of Mr. Kruschev to waive his earlier
demands for a peace treaty before Christmas, and the reasons for it
are worth considering. It is reasonable to assume that part of the
answer lies within the difficulties which the Soviet Union are
experiencing inside the Communist bloc. Another cause is probably the
spirited reaction of the so-called uncommitted nations to the gigantic
exercise in atomic explosions carried out by the Russians. Mr.
Kruschev and his friends have succeeded in shocking a large part of
the world that might have been more friendly towards them by their
callous indifference to the consequences of these explosions that have
threatened the health of the whole world, not least the Russian people
themselves. Another important factor is the way in which the West
have stood firm, refusing to panic in the face of this show of atomic
might.
   <p>It appears that Mr. Kruschev has had to concede that
negotiation is the only way he can attain his ends short of war, on
which he is obviously not prepared to embark. He has toned down his
demands by placing the emphasis on the need for the four Powers to
reach agreement on a new status for West Berlin which guarantees the
freedom of its inhabitants and the freedom of its communications with
the West. The conclusion of a peace treaty becomes an also-ran. But
it is there, and, despite what obligations the NATO powers
may feel towards West Germany, a time will come when a divided
Germany, and, indeed, a divided Berlin, must be recognised by the
West. There is only one alternative, and that, again, is war. Or
perhaps there may be a third way out of the difficulty, a way which
has been suggested in several countries. Berlin could be an
independent city and used as a home for the United Nations. It is
true that, whatever happens, the Germans look like being left with a
divided country, in itself a dangerous situation, but, as has been
said many times before, it is the Germans themselves who are at the
root of all these problems and they must be satisfied with whatever
terms their conquerors feel are necessary to maintain the peace of the
world.
<head>Spiritual values</head>
   <p>WHEN Mr. Butler opened a new social sciences building at
Nottingham University yesterday he discussed a problem which is
important to us all and one that has exercised his consideration for
many years, particularly since he became Home Secretary. His concern
was with the problem of juvenile delinquency and the need for ways of
combating this social evil. He said that he was going to hold a
conference in London to launch a campaign aimed at increasing the
moral and spiritual content of school life. He submitted that in our
society there was evidence that education was failing to keep up with
the increasing tempo of materialism.
   <p>It is, of course, this aspect of the matter that is disturbing
the Home Secretary. One of the great tragedies of modern times is
that our busy schools are kept at full stretch educating the young in
the practical things which they will need to make their way through a
highly complicated world. But this is not enough, as Mr. Butler
knows, and moral and spiritual values must be restated clearly and
taught as an essential part of living. Religion is a difficult
subject at school where a balance has to be kept between the various
denominations, but time should always be found for communal devotion
that is acceptable to all. It is a lamentable fact that many of our
children today feel embarrassed and uncomfortable at the idea of
worshipping God.
<head>The new look</head>
   <p>IT was a heavy, distasteful task that fell to Mr. Frank
Foulkes yesterday. For Mr. Foulkes is, of course, the president of
the Electrical Trades Union, and it was in that Union, and it was in
that capacity that he announced the results of the elections for the
membership of the union's general executive, in which the Communists
have suffered an overwhelming defeat. Naturally Mr. Foulkes, who is
himself a Communist, put as good a face on it as was possible in the
circumstances, but it did not amount to much. After all, there is no
gainsaying the facts, which are that the Communists, instead of having
a majority of eight to three, as was the case after the previous
elections, are now reduced to a minority of two to nine. <quote>I would
only say,</quote> remarked the president, <quote>that it is a matter for the
members. I have always said that our members are always right until
they have been proved wrong, even when they have taken unofficial
actions against an employer.</quote>
   <p>And this, certainly, is in accordance with the Communist creed,
but now the members, that is, the rank-and-file members, have cut
right across it. They have taken the democratic path, as a result of
which it is very possible &mdash; but no more than possible at the moment &mdash;
that the ETU may be readmitted to membership of the Trades
Union Congress. Here, however, much, if not indeed all, may depend on
the attitude of Mr. Foulkes. For while, he said yesterday, he
thought it probable that the Labour Party would agree to the
reaffiliation of the union, he did not know whether, in the event of
his not resigning the presidency, the TUC itself would agree.
But, he added, <quote>if affiliation to Congress depends on my
resignation, we will not be affiliated, I can assure you.</quote> This
was, of course, a reference to the directive by the TUC
General Council before the actual expulsion of the union, asking
that Mr. Foulkes should resign his office and submit himself again
to the members for re-election.
   <p>There can be no doubt, however, that readmission is what the
members, or at least the vast majority of members, of the ETU
want. But apart from whether or not this actually comes about, a
heavy blow has been struck against Communist influence, one that
should, and could, have been struck long ago. For the executive of a
British trade union can always be called upon to give an account of
its stewardship to those who elected it. If what is tantamount to
dictatorship &mdash; and dictatorship is the mainspring of the Communist
creed &mdash; is suffered to continue in a union it can only be put down to
apathy on the part of the ordinary members. Apathy in others is the
main ally of the Communists. It is what has enabled them to rule the
roost for so long in the councils of the ETU. But now there
is to be a change at the top, one which it is to be hoped will be
reflected in policy and performance.
<head>Barrier to peace</head>
   <p>PRESIDENT \DE GAULLE'S recent optimistic statement on the
prospects of the Algerian problem makes somewhat curious reading in
the light of the latest developments as reported from Oran. For
yesterday it was announced that ex-General Raoul Salan has ordered a
progressive recruitment of the whole of the European male population
in Algeria for the illegal OAS army, of which he is the leader.
Salan, it will be recalled, was in France sentenced to death in his
absence for treasonable acts against the State. He is determined,
come what may, that Algeria shall remain French, and that despite
whatever the native population may say or do in the matter. Salan, in
short, is one of \de Gaulle's bitterest opponents.
   <p>He has, too, certain advantages, although these will not
necessarily prove decisive. For one thing, he is the man actually on
the spot, even though he may weave his plots from an <quote>underground</quote>
headquarters. And indeed he has little if any option here, for to
come out into the open would obviously carry with it very serious
risks for himself; he might be captured and taken under guard to
Paris, in which case it would undoubtedly go hard with him. There is
still that sentence of death hanging over him. But President \de
Gaulle, too, has advantages on his side. He has, presumably, the main
weight of native opinion behind him, not to mention the considerable
resources of the French Government itself. Nevertheless, the omens
are not at all good. All the indications are that there is a long way
to go before the Algerian problem is finally resolved.
<head>Grants to students</head>
   <p>WHATEVER blemishes there may be in the new Education Bill,
the second reading of which was moved by Sir David Eccles in the House
of Commons yesterday, it is fair to say that so far as its fundamental
principles are concerned it should prove acceptable to the vast
majority of the public. In the matter of grants to students attending
first-degree courses at universities, there are, as things stand at
present, certain inequalities that cry out for correction, and it is
one of the main purposes of the Bill to bring this about. As the
Minister said, the measures proposed are not likely to satisfy
everybody in all respects, but the desirability of automatic awards
and uniformity of treatment is generally accepted. The grants system,
remarked Sir David, had grown over the years to a most complicated
animal.
   <p>Not that it is expected that the Bill will result in any really
significant increase in the number of awards students  at
universities. But once a student has been accepted for a first-degree
course, and has the necessary qualifications, then the award would be
his (or hers) by right. And so far as local education authorities are
concerned, the Bill would impose upon them the duty of making these
awards, and would empower the Minister to prescribe financial and
other conditions, with which they would be obliged to conform.
Moreover, it is intended that future Governments should be committed
to ensure that public funds available for such purposes keep pace with
the increase in the number of university students. In future, a
student would know for certain, no matter where he lived, precisely
how he could qualify for an award, and how the amount of that award
would be determined. As for the means test, that would be retained,
though in a relaxed form.
   <p>But the Bill has another purpose, one concerning school-leaving
dates for children aged fifteen. The intention here is to reduce
these dates in the school year from three to two, that is, at Easter
and the end of the summer term. This would seem to be, in effect, a
compromise between what would be the ideal method from the point of
view of school organisation on the one hand and the requirements of
industry on the other. For so far as the organisation of the schools
is concerned, the best, most convenient plan would undoubtedly be to
have only one leaving date in the year, but then that would obviously
pose certain special difficulties for industry. It would mean, as Sir
David pointed out, that practically a whole age group would be looking
for jobs at one and the same time. In such circumstances it would
find it hard, and perhaps, indeed, impossible, to absorb within a
reasonable time all the young people who had thus been thrown, at one
swoop, so to speak, on to the labour market.

<text id=LOBB18>
<head>A FAMILY AFFAIR</head>
   <p>THE flood of facts and opinions lately released from the
conference season may at times seem indigestible to the layman.
Perhaps this is particularly true at this time of year when many
conferences have been dealing with education in its various forms.
Yet there are few subjects more vital to the future of the nation and
ourselves as individuals, and a great many of the discussions are at a
level which is readily understandable to the layman. The truth is
that every layman (and woman) owes it to himself and his children to
take a greater interest in education, for the basis of all education
is the family.
   <p>This is a point which has been made many times before, but it
cannot be overemphasized. And it should be more widely appreciated
that the family influence for good is not necessarily related to a
high level in income. Miss M. G. Green, headmistress of
Kidbrooke School, London, and a member of the Crowther Committee, made
this clear when she addressed the North of England Education
Conference in Newcastle the other day. The best parents are not those
with high incomes or from the professional classes, she said. They
are those who are prepared to put themselves out and make sacrifices
to see that their children have advantages which they themselves
lacked. Indeed it has always been so.
   <p>And for those who believe that the family is a waning influence
because of declining moral standards, the distraction of television,
or some such modern menace, real or imagined, there was heartening
re-assurance from a speaker in Glasgow. Mr John A. Mack,
Stevenson Lecturer in Citizenship at the University of Glasgow,
speaking on the eve of a three-day meeting held by the Science
Masters' Association of Great Britain, told his audience that although
family ties were weakening, the family was the toughest, most
flexible, most adaptable, most ineradicable institution in the history
of human society. Such intensive studies of family life as had been
made indicated that this ancient and formidable institution was
standing up well to the strains of modern life.
   <p>Yet the family unit, virtually indestructible as it may be, is
often capable of improvement as an instrument of education. The means
of improvement are available to all. Only the will is sometimes
lacking. True comprehensive education can be achieved only when
parents, teachers, and children, work as a team &mdash; with the senior
members occasionally exercising the veto of authority.
<head>MERGER MOVES</head>
   <p>THE bargain struck with shipbuilding workers to help improve
the competitive power of the industry in return for an immediate wage
increase is by no means one-sided. Reorganization of the yards may
have an important part to play. One of the most experienced
shipbuilders on the North-East Coast, Sir William Gray, chairman of
the West Hartlepool shipbuilding, repairing and engineering company
which bears the family name, said recently that more integration of
shipyards would achieve economies and lead to better planning. His
view was that larger units, operating more closely together, could
undertake research aimed at producing ships which are technically more
advanced.
   <p>There are two schools of thought about the advantages of
consortiums &mdash; one believes that they lead inevitably to cheaper ships
and engines: the other, that they can become administratively top
heavy and out of touch with what is happening in shops and ships. The
experience on Wearside of grouping of shipyards is that efficiency
improves without the loss of the family ties which have established
the river's reputation for good ships and good relationships at yard
level.
   <p>Exploratory talks are now about to begin into the possibility of
a closer link between William Doxford and Sons and the Sunderland
Shipbuilding Group (which includes the North Sands and Deptford
Shipyards). A statement issued by the two companies uses the phrase
<quote>increased co-operation,</quote> thereby inferring quite accurately that
the two concerns already work together. A check of the ships launched
by Laing's and Thompson's shows that in recent years a high proportion
have been fitted with Doxford machinery. And there could be no
clearer indication of the Sunderland Shipbuilding Group's faith in the
Doxford product than its decision to equip the 20,000-ton
Deptford-built tanker Montana with the first Doxford <quote>P</quote> engine.
   <p>The talks are confined at this stage to a full and frank exchange
of views and any speculation is premature. Nevertheless the companies
have announced their intention to the London Stock Exchange. It may
be some months before a further statement is made but one has been
promised when <quote>the position is clarified.</quote> Meanwhile the second
ship to be fitted with a <quote>P</quote> engine will be launched next week on
the Wear &mdash; and the builders are Thompson's.
<head>RELAXING A BAN</head>
   <p>WEAR shipbuilders, experiencing difficulty in engaging
skilled platers, welcome the decision of the district committee of the
Boilermakers' Society to allow a limited number of boys to train as
platers. So, too, will all others with an interest in Sunderland's
basic industry. It is more than two years since the Society imposed
its embargo on the entry of apprentices into the yards because of
unemployment among its adult members.
   <p>Although the number of boilermakers who are out of work has been
reduced steadily during the past year, the Society does not consider
that the time is opportune to relax the ban so far as welders,
riveters, burners and heaters are concerned. The shipbuilders,
however, put forward an irrefutable case for resuming apprenticeships
in the plating trade and here the Wear District Committee of the
Society has given ground, although the intake will still be strictly
limited.
   <p>The Society has stated that it is watching closely unemployment
among its members so that the ban can be raised as soon as possible.
The Wear Shipbuilders' Association considers that full recruiting of
apprentices should be resumed immediately if the best interests of the
industry, the union and the boys are to be served. If the level of
shipyard unemployment continues to fall on Wearside, the Society will
find itself hard pressed to justify its action in depriving upwards of
one hundred boys a year of the opportunity to train in the town's
chief industry.
<head>STRIKING APPEAL</head>
   <p>THE 58,000 people who saw Sunderland defeat Arsenal at Roker
Park last Saturday included probably a preponderance of trade
unionists. Yet very few of this majority could have regarded the game
as a combined operation between fellow trade unionists. There were
occasional delicate demarcation disputes, it is true, but for the most
part mass partisanship recognized no boundaries, and certainly did not
easily concede equal rights to the white-shirt workers.
   <p>All that, however, may soon be forgotten if the threatened
footballers' strike kicks-off on January 21, one week before
Sunderland are due to visit Liverpool on urgent business. The
T.U.C. and the Ministry of Labour have already become
involved, and now an emergency resolution is being sent to the North
East Federation of Trades Councils from the Jarrow and Hebburn branch
urging moral and financial support designed to keep crowds away from
any game which might be arranged, other than by the players
themselves. (Hitherto the problem has been to get the crowds in.)
   <p>In the name of working solidarity the good trade unionist is
asked to change his leisure habits in support of players who may cease
to play, and, for good measure, to give up his chance of an overnight
fortune by boycotting football pools, too. There is a danger that
even the white ball will be declared black. Whatever the rights or
wrongs of the dispute, the impartial spectator &mdash; if one can still be
found &mdash; will surely agree that rarely has trade union loyalty faced a
more baffling test.
<head>COLD WAR FRONT</head>
   <p>THE announcement by the Medical Research Council that
experiments at the Common Cold Research Unit at Salisbury are having
to be postponed because of a shortage of volunteers is not to be
sneezed at. Apparently people who are quite prepared to take a 50-50
chance of catching cold during the summer shrink from the risk in the
winter months, notwithstanding the promise of a free pint of beer each
day and 3s pocket money. In view of the importance of the
experiments and their potential value to suffering humanity this
seasonal lack of <quote>guinea pigs</quote> is, of course, regrettable, but is
the explanation quite so simple? Could not the shortage be due to the
grip the common cold takes at this time of the year of places and
people far removed from Salisbury?
   <p>Wearsiders, for example, may reasonably reflect that there is not
much point in making a sacrificial journey to Wiltshire if the object
of the pilgrimage overtakes one at Newbottle, Shiney Row, Pity Me or
Cold Hesledon. Come to think of it, any of these places &mdash; and others
whose names contain less cold comfort &mdash; might well claim to have
Common Cold Research Units of their own at this season. The problem
is that a common remedy is uncommonly difficult to find. In fact, the
only discovery to which most of us would subscribe is that established
long ago by an American sufferer. A cold is both positive and
negative: sometimes the Eyes have it and sometimes the Nose.
<head>HOME AND SAFETY</head>
   <p>FEW men would covet a constantly nagging wife, though many
may have difficulty in escaping occasional one-sided exercises in the
ungentle art of feminine raillery. Yet it seems that in certain
circumstances a nagging wife can be an asset. According to Coal Board
officials who made 1960 a special <quote>safety</quote> year for Yorkshire
miners sharp tongues at home may have helped to reduce the number of
deaths and serious injuries.
   <p>At the start of the year 120,000 miners each received a letter
from the divisional chairman urging them to be more safety conscious.
It was sent by post to the men's homes so that wives could also read
it &mdash; and perhaps nag their menfolk into taking extra care. Now
provisional accident figures for the year suggest that wifely
strictures were by no means ineffective since rates for both deaths
and injuries were reduced.
   <p>Seriously, however, it is doubtful whether miners' wives ever
need prompting in their concern for their men's safety in the pits.
An efficient pit is a safe pit, is the slogan in the Durham Division,
and the fact that the accident rate in this coalfield is lower than
the national average is at once a measure of progress and an incentive
to further improvement. It may also fairly reflect the good influence
of naturally anxious wives.
<head>ENTER THE UNKNOWN</head>
   <p>UNLIKE his two predecessors in the American Presidency, Mr
John F. Kennedy will take office this week at a moment when the
world is, technically, at peace. President Truman took over during
World War 2. President Eisenhower assumed office during the Korean
War, a conflict which to the Americans ranked close in importance to
the world war itself. The surest way of winning a war is the
relatively simple one of building up physical strength, which both
Truman and Eisenhower achieved. Mr Kennedy, however, takes office
at a time when problems are more subtle and the answers are harder to
find. In wealth and physical resources America is still the world's
strongest nation, but she no longer holds the position of world
dominance which was hers when President Eisenhower took office. Over
the past decade Russia and Western Europe have recovered from the
devastation they suffered in the war. China is developing towards the
status to which her vast population entitles her. New nations emerge
in Africa and Asia which are less willing than were the West European
countries to regard American economic aid as part of a pattern of
political and military co-operation.
   <p>Thus the United States for the first time in her history finds
herself playing a major role on the world stage without being the sole
centre of attraction. Other stars have joined the cast. That the
growth of the other stars has been largely a result of wise American
statesmanship in the past does not make the present situation any
easier.

<text id=LOBB19>
<head>Last years at school</head>
   <p>LORD Amory is to head the Central Advisory Council for
Education during its consideration of the 13 to 16 age group in our
schools and further education institutes. It is within this age group
that outlooks are formed and decisions are taken that lead to
lamentable waste of young people who could make a valuable
contribution to our national life and who do not, for the most part,
make the best of their own lives.
   <p>Lord Amory's long-standing interest in youth &mdash; particularly in
the young teenagers now to be considered &mdash; will be of great value to
the Council as will his personal experience in medium-sized industry
in which large numbers of youngsters must find their first jobs.
   <p>One of the most important considerations for the Council will be
the use made of the last year in school and the use to be made of the
additional year when the leaving age is raised to 16. It took far too
long for the secondary modern schools to adapt themselves to the new
situation when the leaving age was raised to 15, and the Council will
no doubt feel that much more positive planning must be done soon to
prepare for a further year.
   <p>They will have a lot of useful evidence from the experience of
the schools in dealing with the 14- to 15-year-olds. The pattern has
been very uneven over the country, but at least the evidence is likely
to be highly informative.
   <p>Reduced to its simplest form, the problem is whether the last
year in school (for those children who will not go on to a grammar or
senior technical school) should be used to broaden the youngsters'
minds or for elementary vocational training to equip them for jobs.
Apart from the broad arguments about desirability one way or another
there are often local complications when particular kinds of industry
need regular intakes of school-leavers in particular localities.
   <p>Any teacher will agree that it is impossible to pursue both lines
effectively during a single year. Some formal subject teaching must
go on in either case. The time left over can be fully occupied either
in lectures, discussions and demonstrations aimed at broadening the
understanding or in practical group work taking in pre-apprenticeship
training, but it will not accommodate both.
   <p>It might be that when the leaving age is raised to 16 the last
two years should be marked by a departure from strict subject
teaching. Vocational training and appreciation courses could then be
developed in one two-year curriculum with some hope of success in both
directions.
   <p>While the Advisory Council will be concerned mainly with children
of average ability, they are charged also with considering those who
fall below the average. It seems a pity that the terms of reference
should cover both and it is to be hoped that the Council's report will
treat them separately for special provisions may have to apply in the
second case.
<head>S. Rhodesia agreement</head>
   <p>PERHAPS one does not have to look very far for an explanation
of the unexpected agreement on the constitutional future of Southern
Rhodesia. It illustrates the fact that an ounce of example is worth a
ton of exhortation.
   <p>The example that has confronted Southern Rhodesia is the Congo,
and reports from Salisbury show that Africans and Europeans alike have
been severely shaken by the realisation of what can happen when
political extremism leads to a break-down in the rule of law.
   <p>Africans in Southern Rhodesia do not want to lose what they have
gained in the past, little though it may be. The European community
certainly does not want to see everything they have created come
crashing down about them.
   <p>Neither side can go forward alone. The fact that African and
European leaders have now decided to go forward together, even a
limited distance, is the most encouraging event in Central Africa
since federation of the three territories there took shape.
   <p>It is still too early to see what the effect will be upon
Northern Rhodesia, where the European community is much smaller, but
there are grounds for hope, even though the present constitutional
conference in London may achieve little.
   <p>Hitherto, it has been the Europeans in Northern Rhodesia who have
favoured federation and the Africans who have mainly opposed it (on
the ground that it would mean permanent subjugation to the powerful
European community in Southern Rhodesia).
   <p>Now, with signs of a more liberal outlook in the south, and with
the prospect of an advance in the Africans' position there, a
softening of the attitude of the Africans in Northern Rhodesia is
possible. This, in turn, should ease or remove some of the worst
fears of the Europeans among them.
   <p>Thus &mdash; and this in the long run is the really important gain &mdash;
there is once again some hope that the Central African Federation can
remain in existence instead of being torn apart either by the Southern
Rhodesian Government's determination to go its own way or by African
suspicions.
   <p>Federation is essential if this area of Africa is to develop the
economic means to sustain political advance. Racial and political
divisions still threaten it, but today there is new hope where only a
week ago there was little but despondency and suspicion.
<head>PICCADILLY CIRCUS</head>
   <p>AT first glance Sir William Holford's design for the new
Piccadilly Circus is extremely disappointing. Indeed, it is more than
that. It is alarming. Many people will ask, ~<quote>Is this really what
is to become of Piccadilly Circus,</quote> and will shrink from the
thought.
   <p>Architectural models are liable to be misleading because they are
viewed from an above-the-rooftops position. In practice no one will
ever stop to contemplate the Circus from such a level &mdash; from this
angle it would be a fleeting view with swiftly-changing vistas seen
from a helicopter.
   <p>Looked at from above, the model of the Holford scheme leaves an
impression of congestion, jumble, confusion and meanness. To imagine
a pedestrian's view from somewhere near the foot of Eros does not
contradict such impressions but reinforces them.
   <p>Congestion because the surface area of the Circus seems to have
been substantially reduced from what it is today. Jumble because no
discernible formal relationship between the surrounding buildings and
pedestrian platforms is apparent, and confusion for the same reason,
made worse by the compression of traffic into narrow canyons and
tunnels between and under the buildings and pedestrian decks.
Meanness because of the impression of a meagre square shut in by
immense buildings on all sides &mdash; and meanness because plainly one of
the main thoughts has been to make the maximum use of the available
area for new building.
   <p>The publicity with which the scheme has been launched has made
much of the <quote>gaiety</quote> of the new Circus. But gaiety is an expansive
mood, and the effect of the model is restrictive and oppressive.
   <p>There is something to be said for the intimacy of college
quadrangle, and the enclosed treatment adopted in the Holford design
might be attractive from an Oxford standpoint for this reason &mdash; but
not when an area about as big as a largish quadrangle is flanked with
buildings 10 to 15 storeys high.
   <p>When the Government intervened to stop the building of the Jack
Cotton monster on the Monico site it seemed that, after all,
Piccadilly Circus might be redeveloped in a way which would take up
the opportunities of its situation. The Holford proposal fails on
almost every score to do this.
   <p>A much better solution exists in the scheme drawn up by the
London County Council's architects. It may not be perfect, but at
least it has some of the qualities of spaciousness, harmony and style
that one looks for in a modern city centre. There would be
considerable advantages in going back to this design, even if it
means, as it does, going back to the beginning in this controversy.
<head>A newspaper and its readers</head>
   <p>THE success of the Oxford Mail, which publishes its 10,000th
number today, has been due to the support of its readers, who, we
hope, will share our pleasure in reaching a round number large enough
to warrant a minor celebration. They do us the compliment of buying
the paper, which suggests a measure of success in providing them with
what they want.
   <p>Not that a paper's relations with its readers can ever be quite
as simple as that, or if they are, the paper is probably on the wrong
track. The hunt after circulation at any price has brought disaster
to some papers, and has done the profession of journalism a good deal
of damage in recent years, and it is not a policy to be pursued by
papers in a monopoly position.
   <p>Like most provincial evening papers, the Oxford Mail has a
monopoly as a daily in the field of local news (though we welcome the
stimulus of some competition from the London evening papers). This
imposes obligations. A paper in such a position should do more than
merely please its readers.
   <p>It has to try to cover the whole field of news in its area
accurately and without bias. Points of view which the paper may not
share must be reported. Minority interests must be given their claim
on space.
   <p>This is not necessarily a recipe for maximum popularity. But
popularity by itself is not a good test of the performance of a paper.
   <p>A paper must be prepared to be unpopular when necessary &mdash;
especially a local one which is sometimes exposed to pressures at
close quarters to soft pedal or even suppress when its job is to be
open and provocative.
   <p>So far as the official editorial opinion of the paper is
concerned, it can be argued that a monopoly paper should not take a
strong line of its own. We have never taken that view. We recall an
editor who once proclaimed, ~<quote>I have nailed my colours to the
fence</quote> as a wit rather than as a paragon. And in any event it has
been the policy of the Oxford Mail and Times Ltd., to encourage
differences of view in the evening and weekly papers which are under
separate editorship.
   <p>When boiled down to essentials the functions of a newspaper are
remarkably simple &mdash; though not easy to achieve. They are in essence
to get the facts and get them right, and to provide a fair balance of
argument about matters of controversy.
   <p>There is no need for a paper to be stuffy in observing such
principles. It is an exciting world we live in, and Oxford shares in
most of the things our world gets up to. If the Oxford Mail succeeds
in reporting what goes on, and in shedding useful illumination upon
it, it will, we believe, be recognised by our readers as a job worth
doing.
<head>The Congo after Lumumba</head>
   <p>WHAT next in the Congo? As the situation deteriorates it
becomes clear that the United Nations representation there cannot
remain as it is. To be present but ineffective is worse in some
respects than not to be there at all. It does nothing for the Congo,
it does nothing for the authority of the UN, and it is unfair to
the troops and administrators involved who have to face increasing
risks without being able to achieve anything.
   <p>Govern or get out, the classic phrase of politics, is a choice
that the United Nations must now face realistically. Indeed unless it
is faced there is a danger that the UN representation itself will
disintegrate as individual countries decide to withdraw their men.
   <p>But UN cannot govern in the Congo without a new decision on
policy and that decision cannot be taken unless the countries of the
Security Council agree upon it. That means in practice that Russia
and the United States must find some common ground on which to
approach the Congo question.
   <p>This is where the slightly improved atmosphere between Moscow and
Washington might prove to be of value. There is no reason to suppose
that the Russians will act from any other motive than self interest,
but it is just conceivable that if they can be convinced that the
United States has no desire to exploit the Congo chaos they will
themselves recognise the need to end it.

<head>HOW RED IS AFRICA?</head>
<head>By JOHN BAKER-WHITE</head>
   <p>JUST how red is Africa? To what extent has the Soviet
propaganda machine succeeded in influencing the upsurge of African
nationalism? Has Moscow yet got a firm foothold, political or
economic, in the great African continent? And were the disorders in
the Congo and Rhodesia the work of Red Agents?
   <p>The answers to these questions press not only on politicians,
strategists and intelligence experts, but on all of us. For the
future pattern of rule in the states of Africa must inevitably shape
the pattern of the world.
   <p>In probing for the answers to these questions I shall start by
listing the states where Communism has little or no influence. One of
them is the Kingdom of Morocco, another Tunisia, a third Libya.
<head>Students red trained</head>
   <p>It is true that a few students from these countries are
studying the techniques of revolution in Moscow and Prague, and a
handful of trade union leaders are in Communist training schools, but
the governments are anti-Communist and the people disinterested
 in Red doctrines.
   <p>In the Sudan the Communist Party is illegal, the political
intelligence system alert, and to date efforts by the World Federation
of Trade Unions to capture the unions have failed.
   <p>It may surprise some people to know that Communism, at the
moment, has no hold in Ghana. President Nkrumah is building a
Socialist state, aided by a small number of hand-picked young
Socialist intellectuals, but he has no illusions about Communist
methods. He studied them closely when, as a young man, he lived in
London. When Ghana got its independence Moscow thought the new state
was a <quote>sitting bird</quote> and the Soviet economic experts arrived with
attractive offers for the cocoa crop.
<head><quote>Communists our rivals</quote></head>
   <p>They discovered that the President is prepared to do business
with the Soviet bloc &mdash; but only on his own terms.
   <p>Anxious to become head of a federation of African states,
including the Congo, he seeks to harness the forces of nationalism.
Communism he regards not so much as an ally but as a competitor.
   <p>In Guinea the picture is very different. Just over a year ago I
warned that the Soviet Union was planning to establish in this new
state a fresh bridgehead into Africa. Now she has got it.
   <p>A dedicated Marxist and graduate of Prague University, President
Sekou Toure is what the cynical planners in the Kremlin call <quote>in the
net.</quote> He is bound to the Soviet bloc by loans and trade agreements.
He has accepted technicians in large numbers from Russia, East
Germany and Poland. The Czechs are reshaping and equipping Guinea's
army and police. Chinese technicians have taken charge of the rice
growing plan.
<head>Red-made</head>
   <p>In Conakry, the capital, shops are full of Czech matches,
cigarettes and watches, Chinese rice, East German typewriters and
Russian textiles. Czech cement is building the new docks, German
machinery equipping the new factories. A Conakry-Prague air service
is opening up, a Communist-controlled school for African trade union
leaders is open already.
   <p>Since the beginning of the year five international Communist
organisations have held conferences at Conakry. One of them was the
Afro-Asian Solidarity Council, based in Cairo, and, for the past three
years, Moscow's main propaganda weapon in Africa. I predict that
within the next six months the Council will move permanently to
Conakry, for Guinea &mdash; not Cairo &mdash; is now the most important Red
bridgehead in Africa.
   <p>The violent revolt against Belgium, the tribal conflicts and
other disorders in the Congo were neither Moscow-planned nor directed.
There is evidence that the Russians were just as surprised as anyone
else at the suddenness and violence of them, but it is, of course, a
situation ideal for exploitation.
<head>Communist army head</head>
   <p>At least two of Mr. Lumumba's entourage have had some
training in Moscow, and the officer in charge of the Guinea contingent
of the U N forces in the Congo is a fully indoctrined Communist.
   <p>Three Czech <quote>advisers</quote> accompanied the contingent, and now a
thirty-strong Soviet <quote>technical mission</quote> has arrived in
Leopoldville. It may be pure coincidence that they are all tall,
well-built men in their middle-thirties, but they look uncommonly like
Red Army officers in plain clothes.
   <p>Communism had little or nothing to do with the riots in South
Africa or the more recent disorders in Rhodesia. In fact, former
leaders of the Communist Party in the Union have left the country.
Some are now in the Rhodesian copper belt and at least one of them is
in London.
   <p>In contrast, Moscow has embarked upon a special operation in
Ruanda-Urundi, which borders on the Belgian Congo. This state of some
21,000 square miles and a population of 4,630,000 has been a United
Nations trust territory under the administration of Belgium, but a few
days ago she announced that she was giving up the trusteeship.
   <p>In the early part of August a Soviet agent named Nikolay Khokhlov
arrived in the capital Usumbura, and made contact with the
vice-president of the United Movement Party, Paul Kabandrouka.
Through Khokhlov he sent a message to Moscow. <quote>Let the U S S
R know that Ruanda-Urundi demands independence, demands it
urgently and without delay.</quote>
   <p>I smell trouble here. The conditions exist for it and trouble
would suit Moscow's purpose admirably. It joins the frontiers not
only of the Congo but also of Tanganyika and Uganda, a British
trusteeship and protectorate moving towards self-government.
Ruanda-Urundi is a place to watch.
<head>Secret police ruthless</head>
   <p>Colonel Nasser and the United Arab Republic have economic ties
with the Soviet bloc and the Soviet mission has underground contact
with the leaders of the rebel National Liberation Front at their
headquarters in the Street of the Blue Mosque in Cairo. On the other
hand, the secret police has been known to deal ruthlessly with
Communist agitators.
   <p>While he was living in London the Communists made a number of
approaches to Dr. Hastings Banda, the Nyasaland nationalist leader,
but there is evidence that, like President Nkrumah, he has few
illusions about how Moscow uses African nationalism to achieve its own
purposes. Among the states in the French Community that the Soviet
propagandists are paying particular attention to are Madagascar and
the Cameroun, facts to which the French are alive.
   <p>While Moscow continues to step up the radio barrage on the ears
of African listeners, the most significant developments in the
propaganda offensive in the coming months will come from Peking.
<head>China radio propaganda</head>
   <p>The China-Africa Friendship Association has been formed,
inter alia, <quote>to support the joint struggle of the African
peoples in opposing imperialism and colonialism.</quote> Radio Peking's
output to Africa is now 550 hours a week, and includes special
broadcasts in Cantonese to overseas Chinese in South Africa,
Madagascar and Mauritius.
   <p>A recent check on a book-store on  Conakry showed that
there were 14 Chinese publications on sale, compared with three
Russian and one Czech. One of the latest Peking publications is a
training manual for African trade unionists.
   <p>The 23-man Chinese delegation which attended the Solidarity
Council meeting in Conakry was the largest of all, and the official
propaganda agency, the New China News Agency, has opened up offices in
Rabat, Accra and Conakry.
   <p>Africa has been described as a seething cauldron. Both Moscow
and Peking can be expected to take every opportunity of adding fuel to
the fire under it.
<head>BY ELECTIONS &mdash; a new warning to Tories</head>
<head>by RADAR</head>
   <p>CONSERVATIVE Party fortunes are far from their peak at the
present time. And so are those of Harold Macmillan.
   <p>They have slumped as a result of the build-up of a variety of
what the Prime Minister probably prefers to view as little local
difficulties.
   <p>Voters, as the recent by-election results showed, are in
increasing numbers losing their faith in the magic of the Tory
administration.
   <p>This is not to say that the discontented are running to the
Socialists as their saviours.
   <p>There is no new spectacular devotion for Jo Grimond's struggling
Liberal Party, though the Liberal leaders have good reason to be
satisfied with the overall results.
   <p>As is usual at by-elections, the disgruntled and disillusioned
are staying away from the polling stations, not committing themselves
for the time being.
   <p>Meanwhile, millions more people who voted for the Conservatives
in October, 1959, and who have not recently had the chance to vote for
a parliamentary candidate, are talking among themselves.
   <p>
   <p>It is nothing unusual these days to pop into the saloon bar of a
public house and hear the Government coming under fire from those with
the accent of the reasonably well-off.
   <p>There is a widespread belief that the ruling Tories are becoming
more reactionary, trying to please their Right Wing more than their
Left or centre supporters.
   <p>No single act by the Government has done more to foster this
impression than the increase in the Health Service charges.
   <p>On the other hand, everyone but the Right-wing Conservatives
applauded the Prime Minister's <quote>wind of change</quote> attitude towards
dealing with the problem of Africa and the coloured people.
   <p>
   <p>In the event, the wind has dropped to no more than a gentle
breeze. It has been damped down by those who would like to see hardly
any movement at all.
   <p>Harold Macmillan himself has had a difficult time. So far as
general affairs have been concerned he has deliberately attempted to
lie low, let his colleagues build up their own images.
   <p>Last year he put everything he had into trying to bring about a
successful Summit meeting between the leaders of the U.S.A.,
Russia, France and the United Kingdom.
   <p>It was not his fault that the attempt failed. But it was
heartbreaking, none the less.
   <p>As leader of the Commonwealth's principal nation he could not
have found it pleasant to preside over the dramatic branding of Dr.
Verwoerd's apartheid doctrines.
   <p>It is doubtful whether the man who happened to be Britain's Prime
Minister at the time when South Africa decided to end her 50-year
association with this country will be proclaimed a national hero on
that particular score.
   <p>The fact is, Harold Macmillan has lost a lot of ground in the
popularity stakes, needs a new major personal success to restore his
own fortunes, and those of the Party.
   <p>There is still one glittering prize to be grasped. The man who
captures it will go down in history as one of the greatest of mortals.
   <p>What the great masses of ordinary people in the world desire most
of all is the certain prospect of peace for as long ahead as possible.
   <p>
   <p>No one can blame Harold Macmillan for trying to reach the elusive
goal. And few would be so uncharitable as to say that he would like
to do it just for his own sake.
   <p>The Prime Minister realises that he has as good a chance of
bringing about the hoped-for miracle as any man alive. His unique
position as leader of the British Commonwealth of Nations gives him a
better chance than most.
   <p>Once more, he believes, he must try to be the intermediary
between the two great opposing Communist and non-Communist world
blocs. If nothing else, the Americans have to be convinced that the
Government of Red China must be given full recognition, admitted to
the United Nations, and treated as what it is &mdash; one of the leading
governments in the world.
<head>Half the world's crooks are never caught</head>
<head>reveals JOHN REED</head>
   <p>DURING this week in the cities of Rome, Paris, and New York,
it is safe to predict that a total of at least 70 people will be
murdered.
   <p>In addition, there will be at least two major bank robberies,
several hundred cases of rape, and thousands of burglaries and frauds.
   <p>In New York alone a serious offence is committed every two
minutes.
   <p>THESE ARE SHOCKING FIGURES, BUT EVEN MORE SHOCKING IS THE FACT
THAT AT LEAST HALF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THESE CRIMES WILL GO UNDETECTED.
   <p>Experts who attended a recent conference on crime in London
admitted that all over the world crime is not only increasing, but in
many cases the criminal is becoming more elusive.

<head>THOMAS DENHAM, Evening News Diplomatic Correspondent, continues
his series on HUNGARY TODAY, five years after the uprising</head>
<head>Catching up with the Western Joneses</head>
   <p>HUNGARY is not only a Communist country, but in a sense a
new country, trying for the first time to exploit its resources and
<quote>catch up with the West.</quote> Everywhere there are new factories, new
housing estates, new farm buildings.
   <p>Clothes and many window displays may sometimes remind you of the
post-war years of <quote>utility</quote> in Britain. Much is obviously being
sacrificed for the future, but people have money to spend on what is
available, particularly on entertainment and food, both of which are
cheap.
   <p>On the bright days which follow one another in summer the
pavements of Budapest's main streets are thronged. At the week-end
the many fine swimming pools, fed by hot-springs, are so packed it is
hardly possible to see the water, and the resorts down the Danube and
on Lake Balaton are full of couples and families enjoying themselves,
which they can do for a very modest outlay.
   <p>The night clubs are full, and whether you eat in a restaurant or
a private home you soon discover the Hungarians are traditionally the
biggest eaters in Europe, and take a pride in it &mdash; to the distress of
their doctors.
<head>Lively people</head>
   <p>They are enthusiastic cinema-goers &mdash; Hungary must be one of the
few European countries where cinema attendances have steadily
increased in recent years. Television is comparatively new and
limited, and with about 150,000 sets in the country has hardly yet
made an impact.
   <p>The standard, of course, is very different from the hard,
expensive glitter of West Germany. But it is equally far removed from
the dismal greyness of East Berlin.
   <p>The Hungarians are a lively people, with a sense of humour very
much like ours. If they have their troubles and sorrows, in the
towns, at any rate, they seem to carry them lightly. Earlier in the
year, I was told, the riddle was being asked: <quote>What is it that is 30
yards long and eats potatoes?</quote> The answer <quote>A meat queue.</quote> More
recently it was what is 30 yards long and eats meat, with the answer
<quote>a potato queue.</quote>
   <p>I saw nothing to suggest an overall shortage of food &mdash; on the
contrary. The official explanation of the meat queues was that they
were only for pork. There was plenty of beef and other meat, but
conservative housewives preferred to queue for their favourite pork.
<head>Pork shortage</head>
   <p>The shortage of pork could have been satisfied by cutting
exports, but the authorities preferred to disappoint customers at home
to losing customers abroad by not meeting export orders.
   <p>Comparisons of standards of living are difficult to make because
of traditional differences in the way of life and pursuit of
happiness, differences in our social system and the wide range of
incomes. For instance, rents in Hungary are extremely low, running
from 15s. to &pound;2 a month.
   <p>Public transport is so cheap that its cost could virtually be
ignored, and, indeed, it must literally be so by many in Budapest, for
the trams are usually so packed that it would be impossible to collect
the fares even if the customers were anxious to pay.
   <p>A really cheap midday meal is widely available by law, and the
quantity and quality and service is much above what one would expect
in Britain, although this probably has much more to do with tradition
and a feeling that food is more important than the social revolution.
   <p>Deductions for pensions and trade union funds may amount to 4 per
cent., but income tax is not something that has to be worried about.
<head><quote>Norm</quote> of work</head>
   <p>These are facts that have to be borne in mind when comparing
wages, which, at a realistic rate of exchange, average less than &pound;25
a month, with a range of, say &pound;14 a month for an office cleaner to
&pound;50 plus a month for a coal miner.
   <p>As is usual in a <quote>socialist</quote> country, wages depend on
achieving a <quote>norm</quote> of work. The underground coal miner's
<quote>plus,</quote> for instance, is in the form of an annual bonus based on
<quote>loyalty,</quote> i.e., years of service and good timekeeping.
   <p>At a pit I went down, the list of bonuses paid to every miner was
pinned up. The largest amounted to two months' wages &mdash; over &pound;100 &mdash;
and they ranged down to two weeks' wages.
   <p>This makes the miners comparatively wealthy and I was interested
to learn they spend their <quote>surplus</quote> money on much the same things
as here, if they can get them &mdash; furniture, television, refrigerators
and cars.
   <p>The Mayor of Komlo, which has 10,000 miners, told me he knew
several who had refurnished their homes twice in seven years (the
whole city is less than 10 years old), and that there was over &pound;3
million in the local savings bank. But the standard of good
attendance is stiff &mdash; one day's <quote>unnecessary</quote> absenteeism loses
half the annual bonus, two days and the lot is lost.
<head>Holiday rewards</head>
   <p>Among the rewards of good work and conformity with enthusiasm
are holidays at excellent resorts so cheap that the wage-earner can
make a <quote>profit</quote> on his stay. My guide in one town told me she had
been awarded a fortnight's holiday on the Black Sea for her good work.
   <p>These holiday homes are owned by the trade unions, which spend 73
per cent. of their annual income of &pound;6 million plus on social
welfare, culture and sports. But, except through these <quote>official</quote>
channels, the possibilities for holidays away from home must be
limited.
   <p>Although more Hungarians travelled to western countries last year
than ever before, holidays abroad in non-Communist countries are
limited because currency is not made available.
   <p>There are many things in the new Hungary it is easy to like and
perhaps from which we could learn. There is, for instance, the
appetite for education, including self-education, and for <quote>culture</quote>
and the facilities provided for satisfying it.
   <p>There is the lack of class-consciousness, at least in the towns,
where you will find obvious manual workers sitting with
smartly-dressed men and women in restaurants and night clubs.
   <p>There is self-criticism and a great desire to do better.
<head>Dull papers</head>
   <p>A high official in one ministry surprised me by his blunt
criticism of Hungarian papers as <quote>deadly dull.</quote> He said he would
like to see some as bright as the British ones, although, of course,
their contents would be different.
   <p>They can laugh at their own weaknesses, like the belief that it
is impossible to eat in a restaurant without gipsy music, although the
gipsies have disappeared long since.
   <p>What I found depressing was the insistence that all the many good
things in the country were due only to <quote>socialism</quote> and the Party
and would not otherwise exist, together with fantastic ignorance of
the western world or refusal to believe what did not suit the theory.
   <p>To give a couple of instances that stuck in my mind. A woman
journalist insisted that unemployment was our major difficulty in
Britain. She simply smiled disbelievingly at the statement that, in
fact, there were more situations vacant than people looking for jobs.
   <p>A charming and highly-intelligent medical director said: <quote>But,
of course, our system of medicine is different as our doctors aim to
keep people well, while it pays western doctors to keep them sick.</quote>
Hardly able to believe my ears, I asked him if he really believed
that.
   <p>The answer was: <quote>It must be so, otherwise how could they make a
profit in a capitalist country?</quote>
<head>Rigidity of mind</head>
   <p>One can be full of admiration for the things being done &mdash; the
new factories, the housing estates, the new towns, the large-scale
agriculture.
   <p>What is almost frightening is the rigidity of mind which seems to
make it impossible to accept that many of these things are also being
done, and perhaps even more so and better, in <quote>capitalist</quote>
countries; an apparent assumption that everything from free libraries
to large-scale farming and co-operatives to health services are new
and unique in <quote>socialist</quote> countries.
   <p>Of course, these closed minds are not all on one side of the Iron
Curtain. I read not long ago in an English paper a description of
Budapest in the early evening suggesting it was a dark and depressing
city.
   <p>I can testify that, seen from the surrounding heights, it is a
fairy-land of lights, that many shops are open and the windows of the
others lit up. There, as in other Hungarian cities, it is possible
and very cheap to dance until 4 a.m. if you are so minded.
<head>From our Diplomatic Correspondent</head>
<head>THOMAS DENHAM</head>
   <p>BRITISH and American tanks stand ready for action with their
guns pointed at East Berlin, where Russian tanks have been seen for
the first time since the 1953 uprising.
   <p>Since last Sunday, when East Berlin sector guards stopped
U.S. soldiers and officials and refused to let them pass when
they would not show their identity papers, the situation has built up
into the tensest in the history of post-war Berlin.
   <p>The foray of U.S. soldiers into East Berlin to secure the
release of the Deputy Chief of the U.S. mission was the first
occasion American soldiers had entered the Soviet sector since the
city was divided.
   <p>What is it all about?
   <p>Superficially, it might seem that the dispute is about how
members of the U.S. mission should establish their identity when
they cross the sector border.
   <p>In fact, the dispute has arisen out of a bold attempt by the East
German Government to get recognition for itself by the West, and the
determination of the West to continue to demonstrate that East Berlin
is not the capital of a sovereign nation, but part of Berlin which is
under four-power occupation.
<head>Was clearly shown</head>
   <p>If East Berlin were part of a sovereign nation, no foreign
troops and, indeed no foreigners would be allowed to enter it without
permission of its Government.
   <p>Every time Western soldiers or members of the military government
enter East Berlin they demonstrate it is not part of another nation.
   <p>This situation has existed and worked well &mdash; since the defeat of
the Berlin blockade.
   <p>What the East Germans are trying to establish was clearly shown
during one of the hold-ups when one of their radio reporters, doing a
running commentary, told his listeners: <quote>Now the Americans are
negotiating with our officials.</quote>
   <p>This was, of course, untrue, the <quote>negotiation</quote> was a flat
demand for a Soviet officer to be brought to whom they would talk and
with whom they would, no doubt, establish their identity.
   <p>What is at stake, in fact, is whether the West recognises Herr
Ulbricht or Mr Kruschev as responsible for East Berlin.
   <p>The West has no intention of recognising Herr Ulbricht, as it has
made very clear to the Russians in public and private conversations.
   <p>The full story behind this dangerous confrontation shows there
have been miscalculations on both sides.
<head>Were too cautious</head>
   <p>Herr Ulbricht, the toughest and most adventurous of the
Communist leaders, long believed that the Russians were too cautious
about Berlin and that, given a free hand, he could get away with a
bit-by-bit encroachment on Western rights which would result in West
Berlin falling into his hands.
   <p>He had been pressing to be allowed to build his <quote>wall</quote> and
close all but a handful of crossings for a long time before he
persuaded the Russians that any danger of a Western counter-action
could be discounted. In the event he proved right. There was no
Western counter-action.
   <p>This was not because the West was taken by surprise. Its
intelligence had learned it was coming. But it wrongly believed the
wall would be directed only at controlling Germans and that plenty of
crossings would be made available through negotiations, if necessary,
with the Russians.
   <p>When the error of this view became apparent, there was
determination to resist, by force if necessary, the next attempt to
take another slice from the West Berlin sausage.

<head>COMMENTARY FROM City and County</head>
<head>by THE GOSSIPER</head>
   <p>LOCAL booksellers are anticipating a heavy demand for
copies of the new version of the Holy Bible.
   <p>Published today, this mid-20th century edition of the World's
Best Seller is already certain of living up to its long reputation. A
representative of one of Lincoln's leading firms of booksellers told
me yesterday: <quote>We have had such a demand for the new Bible that we
have today put in an order for additional supplies. Many of the
advance orders, of course, have come from clergymen, but we have had
more from lay people</quote>. But he added this warning <quote>We, in the
trade, feel that many people think that this is a new version of the
whole Bible. It is, of course, only the New Testament: it will be
many years before the Old Testament, and the Apocrypha are
available.</quote>
<head>HIS BRIEF APPEARANCE</head>
   <p>THE man who holds the record for length of service as
Lincoln's Member of Parliament &mdash; since the city's representation was
reduced from two to one 80 years ago &mdash; made his briefest ever public
appearance, on B.B.C. television.
   <p>Sir Walter Liddall, elected M P for Lincoln in 1931,
became a member of the Palace of Westminster Home Guard when it was
formed in 1940. And we saw him, for a fleeting two or three seconds,
on parade, in the latest episode in the film series <quote>The Valiant
Years</quote>, based on Sir Winston Churchill's war memoirs. It was a hot
summer's day when the film was shot, in the palace yard, and Sir
Walter, nearest the camera, was on parade in shirt sleeves.
   <p>Many Lincoln people recognised him. And many also noticed the
awful bloomer the producers of the film made in showing a 1914-18
war poster to aid recruiting in 1940!
<head>NEW RECORD COMING?</head>
   <p>Sir Walter Liddall was elected Member of Parliament for Lincoln
on October 27, 1931 and served continuously until July 26, 1945 &mdash;
although some might argue that he ceased to be M.P. three weeks
earlier! The General Election of 1945 took place on July 5 but,
because of the large number of Services votes from distant lands that
had to come in, the count was delayed until the 26th of the month.
Sir Walter &mdash; he had been knighted in the dissolution honours &mdash; lost
his seat, after a period of service of 13 years and eight months. The
present Member, Mr. Geoffrey \de Freitas will pass that record if
this parliament runs its normal course.
   <p>The last General Election was in October 1959 and it is
likely that the next will be in the early part of 1964. Mr. \de
Freitas became M.P. for Lincoln in February 1950 and his term
will have extended to 13 years and eight months by October 1963.
<head><quote>HONEST &mdash; BUT UNREASONING</quote></head>
   <p>To return to Sir Walter Liddall: it was in July 1944 that he
set up his Parliamentary record by beating the term of office of Mr.
Charles Roberts, who was Liberal M.P. for Lincoln from 1906 to
1918. But the all-time record is one of 20 years, held by Colonel
Charles Sibthorp, an early Victorian Member, and one of a number of
gentlemen of that family who at one time or another represented
Lincoln in the Commons. Charles was first elected in 1826 but was
unseated in 1832. However, he was re-elected in January 1835 and
retained the seat &mdash; it was one of two, in those days of course &mdash; until
his death in December 1855.
   <p>That was the Colonel Sibthorp who achieved notoriety for his
outspokenness in debate, and of whom <quote>The Times</quote> said <quote>His name
has long been a household word, as the very embodiment of honest, but
unreasoning Tory prejudice.</quote>
   <p>Frequently, Colonel Sibthorp had to be called to order by The
Speaker for his unparliamentary language, but he did on one occasion
save the country &pound;20,000 a year &mdash; which was a lot of money in those
days! When it was announced that Queen Victoria was to marry Prince
Albert, Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, proposed that the nation
should settle on His Royal Highness an allowance of &pound;50,000 a year.
Colonel Sibthorp's violent opposition won the day and the allocation
was reduced to &pound;30,000.
<head>W.E.A'S JUBILEE</head>
   <p>THE <quote>golden jubilee</quote> meeting of Lincoln W.E.A. branch
forged a new and interesting link in its history.
   <p>The branch has survived two world wars, and battled its way
successfully through the Great Depression. Now it has gone full
circle for, after the austerities of the first war, the grim
despondency of the Depression, and the rationed utilities of the
second war it has met to consider <quote>The Affluent Society.</quote>
   <p>But, possibly even more interesting than this, was the fact
that the speaker was Mrs. Mary Stocks, well-known as a member of the
B.B.C. Brains Trust and radio programme <quote>Any Questions?</quote>
   <p>Though she had paid only brief <quote>passing through</quote> visits to
the city in the past, Lincoln is not entirely unknown to Mrs.
Stocks, for she is the sister-in-law of Miss Helen Stocks who was the
first resident tutor of the branch. Miss Stocks, who took a history
tripos at Lady Margaret College, Oxford, (she did not obtain a degree,
because at that time women could not take degrees) was also a member
of the Oxford Tutorial Classes Committee. Her appointment as resident
tutor for the Lincoln branch followed a visit to the city in
connection with the branch's formation, by Mr. E. S.
Cartwright, secretary of the committee.
   <p>She remained in Lincoln from 1911 until 1919 when she moved owing
to the illness of her father, one time Archdeacon of Leicester, and
later Canon of Peterborough, and settled in Kettering. During the
meeting Mrs. Stocks told me <quote>I always used to hear a lot about
Lincoln. My sister-in-law grew very fond of the city, and never lost
her affection for it.</quote>
<head>COMMENTARY FROM City and County</head>
<head>by THE GOSSIPER</head>
   <p>MY story of the man who had been stopped on Burton-road by an
elderly woman who asked him for her bus fare to enable her to collect
her pension has revealed that this was far from being a solitary
experience.
   <p>Telephone calls from a man at Sobraon Barracks and from a woman
living in Broadway, and a letter from a resident of
Yarborough-crescent, indicate that this begging has been going on on
what seems to be quite a large scale. The caller from the barracks
said the woman asked him the time and when he replied, she said:
<quote>You don't happen to have a few coppers for a bus fare, do you?</quote>
He added that he had known her stop at least seven people in one day,
and collect a few coppers from each.
   <p>The woman who telephoned from Broadway told me she was
<quote>touched</quote> as she was leaving the Cathedral. They happened to be
passing through the doorway at the same moment and the woman told my
correspondent she was very tired, her feet hurt, she had no money and
could not go to the Post Office to collect her pension. <quote>I asked her
where she lived and she countered by asking me where I lived. It was
obvious to me, then, that she was simply begging.</quote>
   <p>There is a slight variation in the tale as told by a reader
living on Yarborough-crescent. The woman asked for her bus fare to
St. John's Hospital. <quote>I gave her sixpence, she told me it was not
enough, so I gave her another sixpence.</quote>
<head><quote>GOOD LUCK</quote> LETTERS</head>
   <p>ACCORDING to a letter I have received, I have been due for a
stroke of good luck today, but so far &mdash; and the day is far advanced,
as I write &mdash; Dame Fortune has failed to smile on me to any unusual
extent.
   <p>The letter, I was told, was <quote>a prayer</quote> which originated in
The Netherlands. <quote>You are to have good luck four days after
receiving this; it is not a joke,</quote> it said, and went on, <quote>It must
leave your hands before 97 hours after receiving it. Just send this
letter and 20 others to some people you wish to have some good luck.
Write it all out 20 times!</quote> It would take me nearly 97 hours to do
it, unless I did carbon copies, and they might not <quote>work.</quote>
   <p>This letter is about as nonsensical as other chain letters
which appear periodically; the only difference is that there is no
money involved here. Just the arduous labour of writing out a
ridiculous letter 20 times. I am afraid it left my hands before the
97 hours were up &mdash; cast into the waste paper basket.
<head>BUS TICKET <quote>SEVENS</quote></head>
   <p>EQUALLY silly is a story I have just heard about a craze for
collecting bus tickets, the serial number of which ends with the
figure <quote>7.</quote>
   <p>A colleague who travels regularly on Lincoln Corporation buses
tells me he has been asked by someone, acting as spokesman for a third
party, to save any tickets he receives from the conductor, the number
of which ends in <quote>7.</quote> When, naturally, he asked why, he was told
that they were saved and then handed in at the Corporation Transport
Department when, in some way which was not specified by his informant,
some worthy cause benefited.
   <p>Mention of this to the Corporation Transport General Manager,
Mr. Herbert Jones, produced the expected comment, <quote>Never heard of
such nonsense.</quote> So please don't start unloading bundles of old bus
tickets at his office!
<head>NOT VENUS, HE SAYS!</head>
   <p>MY reference to the fire which, in February, 1922, destroyed
some business premises in Silver-street, Lincoln, has reminded one
reader of something &mdash; and provided me with an illustration of what
long memories some people have for trivialities!
   <p>I had had occasion, some considerable time ago, to mention that
fire, in connection with something else, and having turned up the
files in the office library, I had quoted a quite picturesque
description which had been given to the Echo at the time by a lady
living in James-street, near the Cathedral. In the course of this,
she had said the planet Venus could be seen shining through the glow
in the sky from the flames.
   <p>Now an anonymous reader writes to tell me she couldn't have
seen Venus that night because it wasn't shining!
   <p>He has, it seems, looked through some astronomical records and
informs me that the sun set at about 5.34 on the day of the fire and
Venus very shortly afterwards, at about 5.50! The fire was discovered
at about half past seven &mdash; by someone rejoicing in the name of <quote>Cocky
Yates</quote> according to my anonymous correspondent &mdash; so it could not
have been Venus that Miss Bicknell saw from her house in James-street.
Any other astronomically minded reader who would like to venture what
bright star it could have been that, for almost 40 years now, we've
been thinking was Venus? We really ought to get this thing straight!
<head>COMMENTARY FROM City and County</head>
<head>by THE GOSSIPER</head>
   <p>WHAT is the objection to utilising the old burial ground in
Beaumont-fee, Lincoln, as a car park?
   <p>It is untidy and, apart from what grass there is being trimmed
now and then, it is not particularly well looked after. Gravestones
are broken and almost wholly indecipherable. Only a few years ago,
the old burial ground in Saltergate was turned into a <quote>garden of
rest</quote> &mdash; for the living, not the dead &mdash; and the gravestones were
taken up, some of them being used for the footpaths. And going
further back, the south side of St. Benedict-square was widened by
taking a slice from the old burial ground.
   <p>The plot in Beaumont-fee, only a few yards from the city
centre, would provide an ideal parking place for quite a number of
cars which today are partly blocking the roads by being parked at the
kerbside.
<head>A WOMAN'S MEMORIES</head>
   <p>A LETTER from an 83-years-old lady living near Sleaford
indicates that Lincoln Corporation had been more reticent than I
thought in releasing news about the typhoid epidemic which killed more
than 120 people in 1905.

<text id=LOBB23>
<head>LETTERS to the EDITOR</head>
<head>DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM</head>
   <p>MICHAEL McCARTHY and Frank Platt in their open letter to
Labour Party members refer to Socialism and the new defence policy
without at any time defining Socialism, except in vague platitudes and
general sentiments with which no-one would disagree. And they don't
write a word on defence, which only in the slightest degree differs
from the Tory Government's present policy.
   <p>For example, the Tory Party and Mr. Gaitskell insist that the
main plank in our defence policy must be that we stay as junior
partners to the Americans, who have consistently opposed any
disarmament, despite the Russian's  offer to accept any
Western proposals on control, provided we agree to disarm.
   <p>This has led to the position of Mr. Gaitskell and his
supporters, which I presume includes Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Platt,
who say give up the British H-bomb and rely on the American H-bomb,
and provide the Americans with bases from which nuclear weapons can be
used.
   <p>This conflicts completely with the official policy of the Labour
Party, which flows from the obvious assumption that there can be no
defence against H-bombs, particularly for our small island, and that
therefore a defence policy for British people must be designed to
bring about a reduction of world tension and an atmosphere conducive
to negotiations for effective world disarmament, which cannot be
achieved if we accede continually to the demands for military bases
from the main opponents of disarmament, the Americans and the Germans.
   <p>Your correspondents suggest that the doctrinaires are in a
minority in the party, and refer to local M.P.s, who support the
official policy, but rather peculiarly do not mention the Oldham
Labour Party or Mr. Leslie Hale, who are both on record in support
of the Labour Party Conference decisions.
   <p>Why is this? Could it be that our two friends hesitate to
suggest that Mr. Hales would be a party to any policy which is not
designed to maintain both peace and British independence?
   <p>Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Platt also suggest that the Campaign for
Democratic Socialism came into being because moderates have lacked an
organised voice. Must we presume that they haven't noticed that 95
per cent of the Press support the Moderates?
   <p>What policy differences have our Democratic Socialists with the
Tories and Liberals? None! Just vague platitudes!
   <p>They say that <quote>the benefits of the affluent society should be
used to assist the less fortunate, and that stress should be given to
public as against private interests.</quote> What, precisely, have they in
mind? Increases in taxation of the rich, to increase old-age
pensions? What would that other Democratic Socialist, Woodrow Wyatt,
MP (who a few days ago advocated relief for surtax payers) say
about such class legislation? How can you guarantee that industry
will operate in the public interest while it is privately owned?
   <p>Our two Democratic Socialists <quote>regard the public ownership of
industries or services as a useful technique to be justified on its
merits.</quote> No Liberal or Tory would disagree with such a vague
platitude. Socialists advocate public ownership as the only means of
ensuring that we haven't two classes in society, one that produces the
wealth of the nation but does not receive the fruits of their labour,
and the other class who own industry, but do not play any part
directly or indirectly in the production or distribution of the
nation's wealth.
   <p>Our Democratic Socialists make a clarion call to all members of
the Labour Party to make themselves heard. For what purpose? To
influence the policy of the Party?
   <p>How can this be done when our Democratic Socialists deny the
right of members of the Party to determine policy, when they insist
<quote>that no-one has the power to dictate to the Parliamentary Labour
Party.</quote> Which must mean that the Parliamentary Labour Party has the
right to dictate policy to Labour Party members.
   <p>Clearly our two Democratic Socialists are suggesting that the
Labour Party should give up its heritage as a democratic party of the
people and adopt not only the essentials of Tory and Liberal policy,
plus a few harmless platitudes, but also Tory organisational
principles, who do not make any pretence of allowing Tory rank and
file members any part in deciding policy.

closing on Tuesday afternoons was abolished and replaced by closing on

   <p>We find the present arrangement under which parcels and air mails
have to be sent specially to Oldham General Post Office on Tuesdays
very inconvenient, and there must be many firms in Oldham who are
inconvenienced in the same way.
   <p>Business firms must be among the largest users of the Post
Office, and their requirements on Saturdays are usually small.

<head>O H G S PLACES</head>
   <p>I WONDER if the Town Council are prepared to state why the
places to the Hulme Grammar Schools have been so drastically reduced.
I suppose the excuse is economy; if so, why not a similar reduction
in the Manchester places, as with fare and dinner grants the cost for
each child must be greater than any other.
   <p>Why pick out one school from four to reduce? Why not a fairer
scheme of a few places from each?
   <p>I shall be interested to see their reasons if they will give
them.
   <p>RATEPAYER.
<head>IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW HOUSING BILL</head>
   <p>MR. FRANK PLATT'S recent patronising offering in your
columns on the subject of the Government's new Housing Bill, was a
pathetic attempt to divert your readers' attention from the main
contention of my recent letter &mdash; namely, that the number of local
authorities who have managed to resist pressure from Socialist
councillors against the introduction of a differential rent scheme is
still alarmingly small. Surely Mr. Platt's ingenuity extends a
little further than such phrases as ~<quote>There is much to be said both
for and against differential rents</quote> and <quote>Local Conservatives who
cannot take time off from screaming emotional slogans about wealthy
council house tenants,</quote> when attempting to defend the complete lack
of any test of a tenant's means before allocating ratepayers' money to
the relief of rent.
   <p>Or does Mr. Platt realise already that there can be no defence
against such indiscriminate and amoral use of public money? Certainly
his compatriots in the Labour Party would do well to grasp the fact
that the onus is now very definitely on local authorities to consider
all sections of the community of ratepayers when formulating their
rent policies, instead of merely where political advantage may be
gained or lost.
   <p>Mr. Platt seems terribly confused in his analysis of the new
Housing Bill, though he is certainly right in the  drawing
attention to the apparent inconsistency of redistributing the
additional &pound;3 million by which the housing subsidies' bill rises
every year, i.e. to cover new building, and failing to
redistribute the existing &pound;61 million.
   <p>One suspects that the Government was wary of the immense
administrative difficulties involved in tinkering with subsidies which
local authorities, after all, have already taken into account when
arriving at a rent for existing property, i.e. &pound;22 1s. for
slum clearance, &pound;10 for one-bedroomed houses suitable for old people,
and &pound;32 for overspill building.
   <p>The annual increment of &pound;3 million will now be distributed in
the form of a general grant of &pound;24, or &pound;8 for all new houses,
instead of a grant for specific purposes as previously, and this
apparently Mr. Platt has not fully understood. Seen in this
context, his assertion that <quote>this &pound;3 million is entirely taken up by
slum clearance, etc.,</quote> is somewhat inaccurate.
   <p>The net results of this redistribution of housing subsidies will
be, first, that the existing arrangements which unduly favour the
larger towns with a relatively high number of pre-war houses compared
with rural authorities who have done most  their building in
the post-war years, will be severely modified. Thus the anomalous
position whereby rents of council houses are higher in rural areas
than in the big towns, though the incomes of tenants are almost
certainly lower, will be swept away.
   <p>Secondly, those authorities which are unable to pass the
financial needs test proposed in the Bill (i.e., where rent
income calculated on the basis of twice the 1956 gross value of all
the particular local authority's houses exceeds annual expenditure and
receive  the lower subsidy) will be induced to utilise all
possible rent resources to balance their housing revenue accounts.
   <p>It is surely justifiable for the Bill to assume that a local
authority is adopting a reasonable rents policy, and collecting in
rents an income which is equal to twice the 1956 gross rateable value
of their property, while pursuing an adequate scheme of rent rebate
for the benefit of their more needy tenants, financed by a
rate-subsidy which would be smaller than hitherto.
   <p>Finally, I cannot agree with Mr. Platt's contention that the
yard-stick proposed will lead to unnecessary Exchequer spending. Even
allowing for the unlikely contingency of building costs continuing to
rise at a precipitous rate, and local authorities suddenly finding
that their rent income falls short of housing expenditure to the
extent of their qualifying for the higher Exchequer subsidy, there is
provision in the Bill for a yearly review of the situation to take
account of the effect of further building by each authority. Mr.
Platt significantly fails to suggest any alternative to the 1956 gross
rateable value test, however arbitrary this figure admittedly is.
   <p>All candidates in impending municipal elections would do well to
prepare themselves for such questions as, ~<quote>Is the rate subsidy we
are paying being used for the purposes for which it is intended?,</quote>
and ~<quote>Is the Exchequer subsidy distributed to those who need it, or
alternatively, is it merely utilised to bring about a general
reduction in rents, regardless of the income of tenants?</quote> For these
are the type of questions to which every ratepayer might justifiably
expect a favourable answer.

<head>A WORD FOR WATERLOO</head>
   <p>AS a former head girl prefect of Waterloo School I think
someone should put a stop to all this idle gossip about the pupils.
At any school you will find the odd one or two bad ones who spoil it
for the rest, and in this case all the pupils are getting blamed for
things unruly children have done.
   <p>This cannot always be blamed only on staff but on the slackness
of the parents, too. Teachers have heard so much gossip about
Waterloo that they are frightened away.
   <p>I cannot blame the fourth-formers for wanting to spend the last
month of their school life at their own school. Nothing can be gained
by this protest because they cannot help it if teachers will not stay
at Waterloo, but my point is that all Waterloo pupils are getting
blamed.
   <p>No wonder there are fights at their new schools if people are
looking down on them because they had to leave Waterloo.
   <p>All this gossip is due to one or two disobedient children which
you will find at any school. You're not telling me that all schools
are perfect except Waterloo, because I know better than that.

well scrubbed with the soap that we have never heard of.

<head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</head>
<head>Subways Preferred to Baths</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Your correspondent S. Armitage quotes a figure of
nearly 5,000 people drowned in and around Britain in 1960. I know
nothing of the accuracy of these figures, although Saturday's
<quote>Echo</quote> mentions a figure of 4,000 every year.
   <p>The point I wish to make is that all these casualties did not
occur among the non-swimming members of our population. In fact, I
venture to suggest it is probable that the greater proportion of these
unfortunate people could swim and in fact might not have been drowned
had they been non-swimmers.
   <p>It is so often the swimmer that ventures out, gets into
difficulties and is rescued, if there is time. Non-swimmers are
content to paddle, sun-bathe and splash about generally at the seaside
and very rarely I think enter rivers.
   <p>I do not believe that a sufficiency of baths throughout Britain
would make the slightest difference to the numbers that flock to our
rivers and coasts during the summer months. It would be an excellent
thing if everyone could swim it is true, but not everyone has either
the desire or inclination to do so. Then again so many people much
prefer the sea or river to the baths.
   <p>Having learned to swim in the sea, I am one of the latter, much
preferring the fresh sea breeze to the heavy chlorinated odour of the
municipal swimming bath.
   <p>If the Council wish to spend our money and gain the thanks of
everyone, by benefiting everyone as they should, then let them set
about providing the town with the much-needed safe road crossings we
so urgently require: these could be subways and so would allow a
smooth flow of traffic on our main thoroughfares.
   <p>One in the Prom. would be sufficient to solve that immediate
problem, and I would suggest two for the High-street.
   <p>This would be of real benefit to motorist and pedestrian, and not
least for the elderly.
   <p>It is astonishing that we should have one subway already at
Pittville Park &mdash; how much more useful it would be under the
High-street! But no doubt it has saved some child's life being where
it is.
   <p>In the interim period let us have pedestrian crossings with
automatic light signals giving <quote>cross now</quote> instruction.

   <p>With regard to the League title the 'Spurs appear to be in an
almost unassailable position; in fact it will be the surprise of the

   <p>The only possible danger comes from Sheffield Wednesday.
   <p>Regarding the Cup, there must be great excitement going on at

   <p>I would like to inform your readers, through your columns, that
these chain letters are illegal and are, in fact, a complete hoax.
They do not have the backing of either the National Savings Movement

<head>People Want What Is Reasonable</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; As a member of the <quote>spoon-fed generation</quote> who
regularly reads your letters, I have often been tempted to write in
reply to some of the ridiculous complaints that are voiced in your
columns. After reading <quote>Free Trader's</quote> latest example, I could
refrain no longer.
   <p>If one follows his argument that only swimmers should pay for a
new swimming bath, surely only readers should pay for a library, only

   <p>What the swimmers are asking for is not a free service, as they
are quite prepared to meet its annual cost by paying a reasonable
entrance fee, but somewhere where they have good facilities for
enjoying themselves and for teaching their children to swim (as,
despite <quote>Free Trader's</quote> statement that <quote>only swimmers and
learners</quote> drown, children have been known to fall in the water).

   <p>SPOON-FED.
<head>Deterring Rates</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; The statement that 5,000 deaths (since amended to 4,000)
in and around Britain in 1960 were due to drowning rather fails as an
argument for a new super swimming bath when it is estimated that more
than half of these people could already swim.
   <p>No one wanting to learn to swim in Cheltenham is prevented. I
hear that there are ten swimming baths in the town, the two
municipally-owned ones losing money in the running.
   <p>Other towns seem to manage to build baths reasonably, e.g.
Worcester &pound;30,000, Norwich &pound;130,000. Why does Cheltenham need
&pound;230,000, when there is no hope of running it, except at heavy loss?
   <p>With the heavy expenditure on new rating, plus a new street
costing &pound;1,000,000, the cost of the Pump Room, new Municipal Offices,
and so on, the eventual rates are likely to deter people from coming
to live in the town, as they would probably be influenced more by
excessively high rates than by the fact that there was a luxury
swimming bath for use in winter.
   <p>Alderman Lipson observed that the Council is apt to recommend new
projects without counting the cost. We are entitled to doubt the
assertion that it is not practicable to cover and heat the Sandford
Bath. Has this really been investigated by impartial experts?

<head>Fox's Instinct</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; I can tell Mrs. Shill why the fox <quote>flees the

instinct.
   <p>A fox is cunning, whether hunting or being hunted, but when
pushed out into the open, being a wild animal it naturally seeks
refuge in flight. A fox is only afraid when death seems imminent.
   <p>The English foxhound has made, and still is making, its mark in
all five continents, while beagling becomes increasingly popular,
especially in the U.S.A.

   <p>Apart from the inconvenience of haphazard half-days, has he
considered the extra staff required to work this system and maintain
efficient service, the small trader being the worst affected?
   <p>Saturday afternoon or all day Wednesday closing has been
suggested. This is not the complete answer.

Mondays for shop-workers?

<head>Land-workers Want Fair Deal</head>
   <p>Sir, &mdash; Landworkers' wages and conditions should be better,
especially the minimum wage, which should be in the &pound;10 10s.
region. Quite a lot of the workers get about the minimum wage, which
is &pound;8 9s. a week, with no overtime allowed. This does not leave
much to live on after insurance, tax, rent and so on have been paid.
There are no canteen facilities, no free or helped-by-cash transport,
and the landworker is out in all winds and weathers.
   <p>Why should the landworker be the Cinderella of jobs? Conditions
for factory workers and other trades have greatly improved, so why not
for the landworker?
   <p>Let us see the landworkers' minimum wage and that of all low paid
workers more in the region of &pound;10 10s., bringing them more in line
with industrial wages.
   <p>Why should not &pound;10 10s. go tax-free and have 1s.
prescriptions, and the same for widows and pensioners?
   <p>I have heard it said by younger men who have left the land that
if the landworker's wage was &pound;10 10s. a week they would return to
the land. So let us see them get a fair and square deal. They
deserve it.

   <p>Sir, &mdash; My wife was recently admitted to St. Paul's Hospital,

confidence and extreme skill, to a successful conclusion, and ultimate
discharge.
   <p>In the painstaking care, attention, and devotion to their
patients, the sisters and nurses were truly wonderful, and did much to
relieve any fears and also assist in every way possible to speed
complete recovery.
   <p>During visits to my wife, I was able to note the human and
personal relationship between nurses and patient; and this, developing
into a close understanding, materially assists the ailing and sick
along the road to recovery.
   <p>It is a pity these kindly people, with their quiet, unassuming
understanding and professional experience, are not more appreciated,
for without these qualities we are indeed lost.
   <p>May the surgeons ever be directed by divine skill in their

of masterly inactivity. In other words, they should carry on as they

<head>Insoluble housing problem</head>
   <p>THE trouble with long standing problems is that most people
get used to them. The housing problem has been with us as a serious
social difficulty for 16 years &mdash; since the close of World War 2. In
the immediate post war years it led to a public outcry. The political
parties vied with each other in their claims as to how many houses
could be built under their own programmes.
   <p>In a way the problem was simpler then. The need was gigantic.
The task was solely to see how speedily it could be met with the
materials and labour available.
   <p>In 1961 the public sympathy is still with those who need housing,
but attention is often focussed more on the young home-seekers, the
newly-married couples wishing to set up a home, but faced with
mortgages.
   <p>There is a tendency for some of us to overlook the still urgent
need for adequate housing for established families.
Chislehurst-Sidcup Council have a housing list of more than 1,300.
With the exception of the North Cray Place Estate, they have built
all the major estates they can. There is little land left in the
urban district, with its Green Belt setting, for either Council or
private developer.
   <p>In what straits those 1,300 live only the Council's Housing
Committee and its officers know. Their work is confidential, as it
should be. What we do know is that the newcomers on the list outstrip
the Council's ability to provide accommodation. At least, that is
what is happening at the present time. We also know that even in this
pleasant district, some families are still living in overcrowded
conditions.
   <p>The view has been expressed in Council that the housing problem
will be with us for many years to come. The word <quote>always</quote> has been
used. If that is to be the case, then we need some shrewd thinking on
what to do about it. What hope is there for the 1,300 and the
hundreds more who will no doubt go to the Council offices in the years
to come?
   <p>The Council are urged to concentrate on slum clearance &mdash; there
are a few slums in Chislehurst-Sidcup &mdash; and at the same time they are
reminded to provide dwellings specially suitable for the elderly. How
can they fulfil all their commitments?
   <p>The decision to sell the houses at North Cray to tenants on
special terms has its merits. It is generally recognised to be good
for people to own their own houses. By this means the Council should
encourage people who would never have envisaged buying their own homes
to take on that responsibility. At the same time, it will check the
trend for the Council to become the landlords of an ever-increasing
number of tenants.
   <p>But it can have only a minor effect on this resurgent housing
problem as a whole. Must that remain with us as a social cancer until
the day that the talk of a move of population away from the London
octopus turns into action, forced on us by sheer desperate necessity?
<head>Commentary</head>
<head>Is our education worth the price?</head>
   <p>LAST week marked the end of the school year. It means
relaxation after a long period of intense activity, which, for many
children, has indicated prospects for the future. Some have said
farewell to schools that have guided and encouraged them, and next
month they will be going on to one of the forms of secondary education
now bestowed. Others have left school to make their way in a highly
competitive technical and scientific world.
   <p>How well they fare will depend on how much they have assimilated
in the years before and after the 11-plus &mdash; that mystic phrase that
has brought quite unnecessary worry to parents and children. As one
head master said recently, there is no such thing as failing the
11-plus. It merely provides a means of deciding the best form of
education for each child, and from what we have seen it certainly
works in the vast majority of cases.
   <p>During the last two or three weeks of the summer term Kentish
Times reporters visited school open days and spoke to head teachers
and members of their staffs. They have visited classrooms and have
seen how modern trends in education are helping to prepare the
children for the years ahead. They have been impressed by light, airy
schools, equipped with the most modern aids. The facilities are
provided, and it is up to the children to make the best use of them.
They have only themselves to blame if they do not.
   <p>Those about to start work will continue to learn and they will be
given every assistance to pursue their studies, not only by the
education authorities, but also by the firms who will employ them.
   <p>Vast sums are spent on education every year; in fact the Kent
bill accounts for the majority of county spending. It has risen over
the years and will continue to rise. The poor ratepayer has to pay,
and it is therefore right that he should ask, <quote>Is it worth it?</quote>
Indeed is it? The future of the country is with the children at
present being taught in our schools. We must see they have every
chance of playing their part.
   <p>There are black sheep in every fold, but the great majority
fulfil our hopes. The price is high, but so is the objective.
Consider all aspects of the question before giving a verdict. That
done, there can be only one answer &mdash; it is worth it!
<head>Commentary</head>
<head>Thefts from cars</head>
   <p>DURING this year so far there appears to have been a marked
decline in the incidence of crime from last autumn's peak, which led
Sidcup and District Chamber of Commerce to appeal for more police
protection and to seek information as to how best their trader members
could protect their property.
   <p>The traders and public at large can, in the main, thank the
Sidcup police for that improvement. They have shown a remarkable
vigilance and alertness in past months. But there is one form of
petty theft which has not abated but appears rather to be on the
increase &mdash; the theft of property from cars.
   <p>Every week there are instances of car spares and accessories, and
quite frequently transistor radio sets, being stolen from parked cars,
according to police reports. In most cases the thefts occur in the
unattended public car parks in the urban district, easy and rich
hunting grounds for the prowling car thief at night.
   <p>The high incidence of these thefts has caused the Sidcup police
to issue yet another warning to the public this week. It is simply to
ask car owners to make sure their cars are properly locked before they
are left, with no property of value left visibly enticing on the back
seat. A locked door is at least a deterrent &mdash; a thief will move on to
easier prey.
<head>Bank holiday tragedy</head>
   <p>IN the last year or so road safety officials have acclaimed
Chislehurst-Sidcup as an area free of accidents during the Bank
Holiday weekends. Technically, the record has not really been broken.
The only major accident of the week-end occurred a few yards outside
the urban district boundaries, but the victim was a Chislehurst boy,
and the horror of it touches us all.
   <p>The cause of that disaster may be revealed at the adjourned
inquest. It took place on a part of the A20 that has a dual
carriageway &mdash; which the people of Sidcup are still hoping will be
extended into this urban district &mdash; so the need for a road improvement
of that nature cannot be argued in this case.
   <p>What is alarming is not only that this sort of accident can still
happen with dual carriageways, but that there could so easily have
been other fatal accidents within the urban district over the
week-end. A number of brushes between traffic was reported to the
police, several of them causing minor injury.
   <p>The people concerned were lucky. The truth of the matter is that
unless there is marked improvement in driving standards on our
over-congested roads other drivers may find themselves less lucky in
the days ahead.
<head>Commentary</head>
<head>Vandalism</head>
   <p>LESS than a year ago we drew attention in this column to the
price being paid by the ratepayers of Chislehurst-Sidcup for the acts
of vandalism committed by small gangs of hooligans. It is lamentable
that we should so soon have to record our disgust and dismay at the
amount of damage still being caused to public and private property,
not only in this district, but also in neighbouring areas.
   <p>Wanton damage caused to a pavilion at Mottingham has cost
Chislehurst-Sidcup and Orpington Divisional Education Committee more
than &pound;400. We record this week that a cricket pitch at Penhill was
badly damaged on Friday night by hooligans, who uprooted the stakes
protecting the square and ripped the turf. Time, money and energy has
thus been wasted because of the anti-social behaviour of a group of
irresponsible youths. Quite often Scout huts are the targets of those
bent on wrecking.
   <p>Unoccupied buildings have been damaged and fittings have been
removed from parked cars. Farmers at North Cray have for a long time
been the victims of vandals and considerable damage has been caused to
buildings, equipment and crops.
   <p>Those responsible obviously have too much time on their hands,
but we cannot accept as valid the excuse now put forward that <quote>there
is nothing to do.</quote> There are many outlets for those who wish to
lead constructive lives &mdash; and the majority do. Many young people
belong to organisations which provide interesting pastimes and
hobbies; and many engage in pursuits that will bring them benefits in
the future.
   <p>We do not pretend that everything in the garden is rosy. There
is always room for more and improved facilities for young people to
make the best use of their leisure time. It is often said that more
is being done for youth to-day than at any other time. That may be
true, but we must deal with the situation as it exists to-day.
   <p>There is the problem of this minority of young people who seem
unable to fit themselves into the modern scheme of things. We must
help them, but we must also take a firm line. Their actions may be
the result of frustration, but there can be no more frustrated people
than those who have suffered at their hands. Hooliganism in any shape
or form must be stamped out, and the public can help by reporting
anything suspicious to the police.

<head>Forty years of achievement</head>
   <p>IT is now 40 years since four ex-Service organisations
amalgamated to form the British Legion to call with one voice for
justice for the men and women who had served their country and, being
demobilised, were in distress and need. In those 40 years the Legion
has achieved much and deserves the salute and congratulations of the
rest of the country.
   <p>Financed by the money collected on Poppy Day, the Legion's only
general appeal to the public, it has given immediate and long term aid
to hundreds of thousands of ex-Service men and women, their families
and dependents. It maintains four convalescent and four country
homes, the latter giving permanent homes to 230 elderly or permanently
incapacitated ex-Service men.
   <p>It provides employment for war disabled in its factories and
industries and, through the Disabled Men's Industries, to home-bound
disabled. It also provides work and homes for tubercular ex-Service
men at Preston Hall, near Maidstone, where the Legion pioneered the
treatment, training and rehabilitation of these men.
   <p>The Legion has contributed largely to the solution of an urgent
post World War 2 problem with its house purchase scheme. In 13
years it has helped 19,000 families to buy their own homes.
   <p>Through the 5,000 services committees throughout the country
temporary and immediate relief is given; aid in sickness and in
finding jobs; old and lonely people visited and holidays arranged for
severely disabled.

<head>Split over Africa &mdash; Welcome news &mdash; Non-racialism</head>
   <p>The deep split in the Conservative Party over Africa gives me no
joy. Much too much is at stake for that.
   <p>Make no mistake about it, the divisions are very serious and
the revolt against the Government is grave. Lord Salisbury is a power
in the Conservative Party and he has used intemperate language &mdash; much
more vigorous than at the time of his resignation over Munich.
   <p>Ninety Conservatives, despite all sorts of pressure, have kept
their names to a motion on the Order Paper in the House of Commons
that is critical of Mr. Macleod, the Colonial Secretary.
   <p>Lord Hailsham would never have counter-attacked Lord Salisbury
with such bitterness, unless this was a split that worries the
Government. To accuse the most respected Tory of them all of hitting
below the belt is going very far.
<head>DO NOT YIELD</head>
   <p>Labour will defend the Government against these high-born and
influential rebels.
   <p>This does not mean that we wholly agree with the Government's
policy nor with the way they have handled things. The Prime Minister
in particular has given the impression to the Europeans in Rhodesia
that he has hoodwinked and deceived them.
   <p>But it is essential that the Government should stand firm. If
they yield an inch, Britain may well have an Algeria on its hands.
   <p>That's why we will not exploit this deep split, but back the
Government against the rebellion in its ranks.
<head>GAG</head>
   <p>The Government has decided to curtail and guillotine debate on
the Health Service charges.
   <p>A Government must of course in proper circumstances use the means
necessary to get its business through. But are the present
circumstances proper?
   <p>If a Government introduces highly controversial legislation, it
must expect to lose parliamentary time. Especially when it has no
parliamentary mandate.
   <p>The Bill is a short one. It is also a tax-measure that ought to
be fully discussed.
   <p>The Government has used the guillotine out of fear. It did not
like the publicity that Labour's vigorous opposition drew to the
health charges.
   <p>But, never fear, we will find plenty of ways of making our
bitter opposition effective.

   <p>ITEMS of news from the motor industry give the impression
that trade is improving and that the employment position is better
than it was a few weeks ago.
   <p>This kind of news will be welcome not only in the car-building
towns here in the Midlands but also in the places where so many of the
component parts are manufactured.
   <p>The Minister of Labour is reported to be taking a new initiative
to improve industrial relations, for example, by bringing together
both sides of the motor industry.
   <p>It is to be hoped that both management and workers will be able
to put forward constructive ideas which will help to push further into
the background the dreaded threat of unemployment.
<head>HOUSING PROGRESS</head>
   <p>There are some interesting items from other directions as well
as industry, particularly one about housing. By the end of this year
one person in every four will be living in a post-war house.
   <p>Also, nearly a million people have been re-housed from slums
since the Government's drive started in 1956. Housing for old people
is being increased and now accounts for nearly a third of all local
government building.
   <p>In the educational sphere, there is good progress. Never before
has there been such a big programme of school building. At the same
time training college places are being doubled to get the extra
teachers needed to do away with the evil of oversize classes.
   <p>A good example of the advance in education is that there are now
twice as many university students as in 1938, and it is anticipated
that by 1970 the number will have more than trebled.
   <p>Another angle of education, not always so well known, is that
there are at present over 40,000 overseas students in the United
Kingdom, many of them from Commonwealth countries recently granted
independence.

   <p><quote>WHAT we want is a society where the individual matters, and
not the colour of his skin or the shape of his nose.</quote>
   <p>So wrote Mr. Julius Nyerere, the Chief Minister of
Tanganyika, in last Sunday's Observer, and he echoes a basic Liberal
belief. Like Mr. Nyerere, Liberals want a non-racial Commonwealth
and a non-racial Britain.
   <p>By the time you read this, we will know whether South Africa is
or is not to remain in the Commonwealth. Liberals support those
Commonwealth statesmen who have demanded her expulsion.
   <p>There can be no room for Dr. Verwoerd's Fascist police-state in
the Commonwealth. If South Africa is allowed to remain, Britain's
prestige in Africa and Asia will dwindle as it did after the Suez
escapade.
   <p>Further, Dr. Verwoerd will be regarded in South Africa as
having won a great victory. This is surely something we want to
prevent.
<head>IMMIGRATION</head>
   <p>Some four-hundred years ago, Europeans &mdash; including Englishmen &mdash;
carried off many of the people of West Africa into slavery, to work
the plantations of the West Indies. Now, the descendants of those
slaves have multiplied, and those tiny islands are bursting at the
seams.
   <p>Jamaica has 20 per cent. unemployment, and it is not surprising
that many of her people are coming to Britain. The welfare of these
people is our responsibility.
   <p>I suggest the following comprehensive plan to deal with the
so-called <quote>immigration problem</quote> &mdash; to a large extent simply a
housing problem.

   <p>(1.) It should be illegal to enforce a colour-bar in Britain in
public places.
   <p>(2.) The Government should attempt to persuade Canada and
Australia to open their doors to West Indian immigrants &mdash; and thus
relieve the pressure on living space in Britain and in the West
Indies.
   <p>(3.) There should be a medical check on all immigrants; criminals
should not be admitted; and all immigrants should obtain a reasonable
place to live in before landing. The help of voluntary associations,
such as the British-Caribbean Association, should be enlisted to find
accommodation for immigrants.
   <p>(4.) Could not Smethwick Council follow the example of Willesden
by establishing an International Friendship Council to fight
racialism? &mdash;

<head>LEFT, RIGHT &amp; CENTRE</head>
<head>Withdrawing the Whip &mdash; Local issues &mdash; Liberal advance</head>
   <p>THE Parliamentary Labour Party took the grave step last week
of withdrawing the Whip from five of its members.
   <p>What does <quote>withdrawing the Whip</quote> mean? It is not, as is
often thought, expulsion from the party. Those five members remain
members of the Labour Party and of course, Members of Parliament.
   <p>But they are no longer recognised as belonging to the
Parliamentary Labour Party: they do not come to its meetings, nor are
they informed of its decisions.
   <p>When the Whip is withdrawn, this fact is reported to the
national executive committee. This is in order that the local parties
of the members concerned can be officially informed.
<head>WHY?</head>
   <p>The fundamental reason for this action was that these five
members deliberately defied a decision taken and three times
reaffirmed by the Parliamentary Labour Party as a whole.
   <p>There is much liberty in the Parliamentary Labour Party &mdash; much
more than in the ordinary Labour group on a council.
   <p>Members can ask what questions they like, speak as they wish
and they can always abstain from voting.
   <p>This should be liberty enough for the most tender conscience.
   <p>The line is only drawn at voting against a clear decision of the
Party meeting.
   <p>Without this rule, there would be no discipline at all; the
Party would be a mob. Every Labour group recognises this.
   <p>MPs who cannot accept this degree of discipline are really
independent MPs. Withdrawal of the Whip makes them this in form
as well as in fact.
<head>AGAINST ESTIMATES</head>
   <p>The five cannot justly claim that they were voting in accord
with conference decisions. This was done by the whole party when it
voted solidly against the Defence white paper.
   <p>The five voted against the defence estimates. It has long been
clear party policy that this should not be done. It would be open to
public misunderstanding.
   <p>The five did not vote against the Tories. What they voted
against was the whole Army and the whole Air Force. No conference
decision ever justified such action.
   <p>The Labour Party is fundamentally more united than before. It
is not the withdrawal of the Whip that causes new disunity: but the
deliberate defiance by five members of decisions by the party.
   <p>Patrick Gordon Walker
   <p>
   <p>AMONG those who like talking politics, and who have been
mainly concerned with African problems these last few weeks, interest
will soon be turning to local issues as the time draws near for the
election of councillors at the several levels of local government.
   <p>This year there will be county council, urban district, rural
district and parish council elections as well as those for the county
boroughs &mdash; like Smethwick &mdash; and the non-county municipal boroughs.
   <p>Interest should also be increased this year as the ordinary
elections will be followed by the elections by councillors of their
aldermen.
   <p>The Prime Minister, speaking at a recent rally in London, said on
the subject of local government: <quote>We put first and foremost the idea
of a working partnership between central and local government in which
each side does its proper part</quote>.
<head>CO-OPERATION</head>
   <p>To carry out properly and effectively many of the aims of the
Government depends upon such a real working arrangement at national
and local levels.
   <p>The development of the social services is a good example of the
need for close co-operation; whilst the Government can bring forward
legislation at Parliamentary level, the work of ensuring that such
services are put into operation depends to a great extent on the local
authority.
   <p>To strengthen local government and equip it better to fulfil its
growing responsibilities, the Government introduced the general grant,
with no strings attached.
   <p>This improvement in the way of dealing with financial grants has
freed local councils from much detailed control from Whitehall.
   <p>Consequently, the councils have more responsibility and should
have a greater incentive to spend wisely the money they receive from
the local people in the form of rates, and from the taxpayers in the
form of Government grants.
   <p>The general grant takes account of the cost of local services and
has been substantially increased each year since its introduction. It
will be &pound;25 million higher in 1961-62 than this year in England and
Wales.

   <p>LIBERALS made another spectacular advance in last week's
by-elections.
   <p>In all four contests the Liberal vote rose, while both Tory and
Socialist votes slumped badly. If we compare the figures in these
by-elections with those of the last three-cornered fights, we find
that the total Liberal vote was up by 13,601. The total Conservative
vote was down by 15,633, and the total Labour vote was down by 22,972.
   <p>The swing to the Liberals was seven per cent. in Colchester,
nine per cent. at Cambridgeshire, 10 per cent. at High Peak, and
over 20 per cent. at Worcester.
<head>ACHIEVEMENT</head>
   <p>The Liberal achievement is all the more remarkable when one
remembers the disadvantages under which the Liberal candidates worked.
They were backed only by voluntary subscriptions, and could not, like
the Tory and Labour parties, draw on subsidies from big business or
the big trade unions.
   <p>Moreover, these Liberal candidates had no mass circulation
newspapers to support them. In the by-election period the mass
circulation papers enforced a censorship on all Liberal views and
speeches. When Jo Grimond spoke to a rally of over 2,000 Liberals in
London, only The Guardian reported the meeting.
   <p>After the death of the News Chronicle all the anti-Liberal
papers suffered from an epidemic of fair-mindedness in an effort to
win new readers. The Daily Herald announced itself to be <quote>fair and
free</quote> and even The Daily Express printed an article by Jo Grimond.
   <p>Those days are now over. The Tory papers have returned to their
usual practice of reporting only Tory views, and the Labour papers
print only Labour views.
   <p>It is left to independent papers like The Guardian and local
papers like the Telephone to preserve the freedom of the Press.

<head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</head>
<head>THE <squote>OPEN</squote> ROAD</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; Could not Nuclear Disarmers consult with the police to
arrange <squote>sit-downs</squote> at teatime on Sundays during Autumn? No doubt
legislation could fix a suitable scale of fines to help finance
National Defence and provision could be made for the passage of
ambulances, etc. &mdash; <squote>BOTHWAYS.</squote>
<head>CAR RALLIES</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; In your last issue there was a letter in praise of
courteous and considerate local drivers. Indeed, ever-increasing
noise is one of the problems of our time and it seems to me that quite
unnecessary uproar is created by those drivers from afar who take part
in car rallies during the night. There was one through Fishpond
during the early hours of Sunday, 10th September, with a check point a
few yards from my home. All the cars stopped there and then roared up
over the hill opposite (Coney Castle) in low gear. The noise was
shattering and I could even smell the exhaust fumes. This went on for
more than two hours, but those who manned the check point arrived with
a flourish well in advance. I have ascertained that it was a Reading
car club, so a good many people on the route must have had their
night's rest destroyed. It all seems so unnecessary. Rally promoters
favour this route. We get several each year and no doubt other places
get their share. &mdash; SHEILA REDMOND (Mrs.), Peters Gore,
Fishpond, Charmouth.
<head>PADDLE STEAMERS</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; In this age of rapid change in the forms of public
transport, it is heartening to read from time to time of small but
determined groups of historically-minded citizens who are striving to
preserve representative specimens of older types of vehicle, such as
veteran motor-cars, early buses and trams, notable examples of the
railway engine, and so on, in order that the solid achievements of the
past may not be entirely forgotten. Two years ago the Paddle Steamer
Preservation Society was formed to preserve in running order an
example of that once so familiar, but now rapidly disappearing feature
of our seaside towns, the faithful old paddle-steamer. A meeting of
the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society will be held at the Lansdowne
Hotel, the Lansdowne, Bournemouth, at 6 p.m., on 30th September,
to form a Wessex branch and all supporters of paddle steamers will be
most welcome. Although the society has been active on the South Coast
since its formation, the Central Committee feel that a local branch
would serve more closely the interests of the members. &mdash; J. D.
BONSALL, Provisional Secretary, Wessex Branch, P.S.P.S.,
Loughrigg, 31, Cowper Road, Moordown, Bournemouth.
<head>SQUIRRELS</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; In your columns a Wiltshire farmer complained because
he had seen people at Southbourne feeding squirrels. Last week <squote>A
Resident of Mere</squote> was moaning because a squirrel had dared to eat
nuts from a tree in her garden. Both correspondents called the
squirrels pests. I wonder. I suppose Man, with his H-bombs, isn't.
Did the Wiltshire farmer expect the money used for purchasing nuts
for squirrels to be handed instead to a fund for distressed farmers?
Did the Wiltshire resident from Mere expect the squirrel to go off
nuts, its natural food, and try eggs and bacon instead? Again I
wonder. I have already asked in these columns how many of the grey
squirrels' sins are real and how many are purely imaginary.
Apparently nobody knows the answer. Don't be in a hurry to point out
damaged trees in Grovely woods and scream <squote>Look! Grey squirrels did
that.</squote> The lordly pheasant can do more damage to a tree on a long
winter's night than a dozen squirrels can in six months. &mdash; ORLANDO
GLYN, Heneford Cottage, Chetnole, Sherborne, Dorset.
   <p>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; I have read with much interest Mrs. Moule's letter
about squirrels in the Sherborne area. I have many times in the past
seen squirrels in the woods across the railway, but they have always
been grey. This summer, however, there has been a red squirrel
frequenting the Slopes, and I have seen him several times in the trees
by the New Road. Once I surprised him in the litter basket, but he
was not at all disconcerted. He jumped up, perched on the lip of the
basket, and we regarded one another on more or less equal terms for
some time at a distance of about two feet. On occasions, however,
when I had my camera with me he must have been investigating Mrs.
Moule's garden. &mdash; H. MARTYN CUNDY, The Beeches, Sherborne.
<head>HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; As a recently-retired member of H.M. Overseas
Civil Service, my wife and I have recently settled in Dorset. I feel
that our experience may be helpful to the many people who are
settling, on retirement, from other parts of Britain as well as from
overseas, in the Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset area. Shortly after
our arrival we were told of the lecture course, run under the auspices
of the Workers' Educational Association and the Joint Committee for
Adult Education for Dorset. We found to our great pleasure that the
lectures were conducted in a very friendly and almost informal
atmosphere, and we have, in fact, made a number of very good friends.
As these interesting and instructive lecture courses are about to
start all over the country in the next two weeks, I would urge those
newcomers to the area to find out the nearest course and to enrol.
They will find immense interest in the lectures and will also make
friends with people who have the same interests and outlook as
themselves. These evening courses are held in all the main centres,
and in a great many of the smaller towns and villages. I do hope that
our happy experience may be of some help to reduce the inevitable
loneliness which follows on a move to a new area. &mdash; P. H.
HAMILTON BAYLY, Masanki Cottage, 25, Tanyard Lane, Shaftesbury,
Dorset.
<head>TEACHERS' SALARIES</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; There seems to be some commotion &mdash; ballyhoo is the
modern word &mdash; about <squote>Teachers and their pay.</squote> It is not desired
that teachers should be pledged to poverty. Nor are they expected to
do their work so whole-heartedly as to look for only a meagre material
reward. But the fault of this affluent age is covetousness, and I
hope that teachers are not unmindful that at the heart of the
Christian religion is a cross which means the letter I with a line
through it, and this means sinking self for the common cause. It
would appear that teachers today are not really badly paid: far better
than I was as a parish priest. Only in my last year was it possible
to make both ends meet on the income of the benefice, and this did not
allow for a three months' holiday. But the clergy did not rebel by
going on strike.
   <p>To talk of a clerical Trades Union as was recently done by a more
or less junior cleric, seemed offensively mercenary minded. As one
who has spent many hours teaching in elementary schools I am jealous
for the honour of teachers, and Church day school teachers, in
particular. Let them not be afraid to endure hardness, if such
exists, and show a good example. Education as a profession, like
other professions, has fluctuated and there was a time when teachers
were shockingly underpaid. But it cannot fairly be said that this is
the case now. The Fisher Act of 1918 decisively raised their status
and pay, and this has gone on, for the Fisher Act was not a standstill
reform. In 1944 came the Butler Act. Let teachers continue to show
diligent devotion to their work, and they will retain public respect.
A dutiful teacher puts his back into his work and is apt to be hard
and unbending. The diligent teacher puts his heart into his work
because he loves it, and this is how I like to think of teachers today
doing their work. In the course of more than 50 years' experience I
could give not a few signal instances of the same. &mdash; W. H.
WILLIAMS, Barton St, David, Somerset.
   <p>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; I note with annoyance the sentence in a letter in your
last issue, <squote>Increasingly, arts graduates are being taken on as
teachers without having any training.</squote> Most people realize that a
graduate has, ipso facto, had the best training that a
teacher can have. Graduates who intend to get on in the State system
have, in their own interests, to conform and take the additional
one-year course that is provided for them. It is to this course that
your correspondent refers, presumably; but in the minds of those
graduates I know who have taken it, there is little doubt that for
teaching purposes this type of additional <squote>training</squote> is a complete
waste of time. If a prospective teacher wants to know something about
e.g. child psychology or the history of education, good luck to
him. He can read a couple of books on each in the three months he has
between going down from university in June and taking up his first
post in September. But it seems fatuous that a teacher who is keen to
start should be forced to spend a whole year on such unhelpful
matters. The assumption that teaching is a job which requires
post-graduate training in the university is one which should be
combated at every turn. The key to good teaching lies in knowledge of
one's subject, experience, and certain personal qualities which this
<squote>training</squote> does nothing to develop. Most, if not all, the one-year
courses &mdash; it is the only useful thing about them &mdash; provide an
opportunity for practice teaching: why should the new graduate not
spend the whole year articled to good teachers in the schools? &mdash;
R. G. PENMAN, Silversmiths, Sherborne.
<head>CIVIL DEFENCE</head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; You describe Civil Defence as a means of mitigating
the frightful effects of a nuclear disaster, while at the same time
you speak of the actions of the <squote>Nuclear Disarmers</squote> as an
<squote>embarrassment.</squote> What a cosy thought! Perhaps your readers may
have forgotten these statements: (1) A very few megaton bombs would
obliterate the major population centres of this country; (2) The
whole country would be subject to <squote>fall-out</squote> radiation of high
intensity; (3) Radiation sickness is a most unpleasant way of dying;
(4) The long-term effects of radiation are extensive and unavoidable;
(5) As a result of the current Russian tests it is estimated that
next spring the radiation level will be at least 100 times that of
natural background radiation, if no further bombs are exploded. May I
commend to your readers a short article on the effects of the
100-megaton bomb, which appears in the current <squote>New Scientist.</squote>
Civil Defence has its purpose. It creates a sense of security, and,
after all, the worst might never happen. But in my view we should be
better employed in embarrassing the Government in this matter. Given
four minutes' warning from Fylingdales, which of your readers would be
prepared to press the button which would send 100 million innocent
people to their deaths? What is our trouble? Either we have lost all
moral sense, or we have developed a technique of double-think worthy
of 1984, or we just don't understand the issues. &mdash; F. HODGSON,
Brendon, Common Mead Lane, Gillingham, Dorset.
<head><squote>IT'S YOUR MONEY</squote></head>
   <p>SIR, &mdash; To reply point by point to Mrs. Dungworth's letter
would take too much space, so I offer some comments which may be
helpful. Some newspapers print quite lengthy reports of proceedings
in Parliament and documents issued by the Stationery Office give
further details. So far as local councils are concerned a ratepayer
can inspect a record of the proceedings on demand. Many people prefer
to ignore the facilities available and then grumble that they were not
told. Professor Parkinson and others ignore one rather important
factor in the present situation. During and after the war much work
on capital projects (roads, hospitals, houses, sewers, etc.) had to
be severely curtailed with the consequence that there is much leeway
to be made up now.

<head>LIFE OF MISS NIGHTINGALE</head>
<head>SKILFUL PICTURE</head>
   <p>The BBC's dramatised documentary on Florence
Nightingale last night cleverly managed to suggest the person behind
the legend.
   <p>While never minimising the immensity of her work, it lifted the
saintly halo which usually surrounds her name to reveal a warm,
dedicated person who accomplished most by perseverance and hard work.
   <p>Most stories of Miss Nightingale begin and end with her work in
the Crimea. This one started from that point and devoted itself to
her lifelong campaign to improve nursing in this country. The
documentary managed to show the obstacles and her devotion.
   <p>Moira Fraser's Miss Nightingale was a mixture of the dramatic and
the sincere. Demure one moment, hard and decisive the next, she
caught the dual sides of a complex character. The production by Bill
Duncalf compressed a long and sometimes rambling story into a
concentrated comprehensive survey of a life work.

<head>FINE SINGING IN HENZE OPERA</head>
<head>GLYNDEBOURNE <quote>CONTEMPORARY</quote></head>
<head>From MARTIN COOPER</head>
<head>GLYNDEBOURNE, Thursday.</head>
   <p>HANS WERNER HENZE'S <quote>Elegy for Young Lovers</quote> is the
first unambiguously <quote>contemporary</quote> work to be admitted to the
Glyndebourne canon.
   <p>By no means a masterpiece, it is in many respects a
representative modern work and the composer is a highly skilled
manipulator of contemporary idioms, with a strong sense of words and
situation.
   <p>The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is largely
a satire on the petty court surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply
egocentric character leads him to sacrifice everything to his need of
inspiration.
   <p>Henze obtains his musical characterisation by means of individual
instrumental timbres and <quote>personal</quote> intervals, and the result is
often less delineation of character than caricature. This is also the
chief, or at least the most successfully executed trait of the
libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly poetic phraseology and
schoolboy humour.
<head>MELODY LACKING</head>
   <p>The composer has a happy gift for musical dialogue as well as
for the grotesque, but he is less successful in extended arioso
passages. The more serious scenes of the opera were in fact often
uninteresting owing to the absence of any memorable melodic invention,
but an exception was the Poet's moment of self-revelation in Act 2,
which was excellently sung by Carlos Alexander.
   <p>The lovers, whose chief scene was cut at the last moment, had
comparatively little to sing, but Elisabeth So"derstro"m gave an
exquisitely touching performance and Andr&eacute; Turp's ringing voice
contrasted well with the character-singing demanded of most of the
cast.
   <p>This was in every case excellent. Dorothy Dorow's visionary old
madwoman had considerable musical pathos, and Kerstin Meyer struck
exactly the right note of hysterical devotion as the Poet's spinster
secretary.
<head>TOO ENTHUSIASTICALLY</head>
   <p>Thomas Hemsley's performance as the Poet's private doctor was
dramatically shrewd and musically well conceived.
   <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under John Pritchard handled
Henze's chamber music style rather too enthusiastically at first, so
that the singer's words were largely obscured, and the composer's very
free use of the percussion made this a difficulty throughout.
   <p>Gu"nther Rennert's imaginative production cleverly conveyed the
crazy, precarious atmosphere of the Alpine inn inhabited by the Poet's
court, and his lighting of the later scenes suggested the ultimate
isolation in which the Poet finds himself.
<head>A FASTIDIOUS COMPOSER</head>
<head><squote>JOURNAL</squote> DEBUT AT CHELTENHAM</head>
<head>From DONALD MITCHELL</head>
<head>CHELTENHAM, Thursday.</head>
   <p>IT was not long ago that Richard Rodney Bennett composed a
<quote>Calendar</quote> for chamber ensemble. Now he has written a <quote>Journal</quote>
for orchestra which was given its first performance in the Town Hall,
Cheltenham, to-night by the B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Norman Del Mar.
   <p>This new work, cast in five short sections, confirms that Mr.
Bennett is one of the most musical of our younger composers.
   <p>He writes, one might say, extremely musical music, of which the
sound is fastidiously calculated and yet agreeably spontaneous and
imaginative.
   <p>He does not in this <quote>Journal</quote> write one note too many. One
wonders, rather, whether he has not written too few. Or, to state
one's doubt more plainly, one wonders whether the invention in this
new work is not a little wanting in substance.
<head>SLENDER IDEAS</head>
   <p>Brief ideas are welcome indeed if they compress a sizeable
thought. It struck me that Mr. Bennett's ideas in this piece were
not so much succinct as slender.
   <p>Perhaps it was for this reason that the work seemed somewhat pale
in character, a criticism that certainly cannot be made of Berg's very
rarely heard Three Orchestral Pieces, Op. 6 each bar of which, even
the most derivative, is impregnated with the composer's personality.
   <p>The cruel acoustics of the hall played havoc with textures which
are unusually hectic and congested, but Mr. Del Mar's heroic labours
conveyed a clear impression of the succession of catastrophes which
seems to be the work's natural mode of expression.
   <p>There is undeniably something grand about the way Berg throws so
many broken eggs into one basket. But one is not entirely convinced
that a relaxation of tension might not have secured a more balanced
and varied work of art.
<head>ANGLO-CHINESE PICARESQUE</head>
<head>By ROLLA ROUSE</head>
<head>The Chinese Bigamy of Mr. David Winterlea: a Manchu-Edwardian
Fantasy. Translated from the Chinese by Henry McAleavy. (Allen &amp;
Unwin. 21s.)</head>
   <p>THE basis of <quote>The Chinese Bigamy of Mr. David
Winterlea,</quote> explains Henry McAleavy, was found among the
single-sheet <quote>mosquito-newspapers,</quote> full of <quote>an assortment of
anecdotes, topical items, and serial stories,</quote> started in about 1870
by Wang T'ao, assistant to the famous sinologue Dr. Legge.
   <p>Mr. McAleavy's version of this <quote>Manchu-Edwardian fantasy</quote>
is, however, so free that to anybody who knows China and the Chinese
nothing of a Chinese flavour remains. What the various characters say
and do often seems utterly alien to China.
   <p>For example, we are shown a Chinese host placing his principal
guest from the Foreign Office in the lowest seat at dinner, accusing
him of being homosexual, and generally behaving as no educated Chinese
ever could behave. Again, the Chinese, whether drunk or sober, never
kiss in public, and least of all would a Chinese monk meeting an
Englishman for the first time kiss him.
   <p>The period covered by the tale runs from about 1850 to 1913: and
all the characters have one thing in common, their coarse behaviour
and abnormal appetites. While there is a story meandering through the
book, the main object of many chapters is to record some improbable
and unpleasant anecdote.
<head>\Amahs into Ladies</head>
   <p>The hero, if such Mr. David Winterlea can be called, tries to
turn two Cantonese sisters from \amahs into ladies and teach them
English: and they on their side plan to marry him jointly and finally
to reside, not in unfashionable Kowloon, but in snobbish Hongkong,
where he <quote>would have a position to keep up.</quote>
   <p>The main incidents occur on a country estate near London, owned
by the Chinese Legation and used by the staff, Chinese and foreign, to
amuse themselves, mainly at night.
<head>BYRON'S VEXED REPUTE</head>
<head>By MARGARET LANE</head>
<head>The Late Lord Byron. By Doris Langley Moore. (Murray. 2gns.)</head>
   <p>NEVER has a greater coil been made about any man than about
Byron. He sowed passions, jealousies, loyalties, scandals,
animosities and treacheries as effortlessly as some far worthier
characters scatter boredom.
   <p>The tumult is by no means over, and this being a biographical age
and Byron a magnificent documenter of his own life, he has reached the
stage (I cannot remember any other great literary figure doing so)
when a monumental work can be written on the dramas that seethed and
simmered after his death, taking off from the point at which the
reader is accustomed to close a poet's biography.
   <p>Is it really worth while &mdash; one is bound to ask the question
sooner or later &mdash; to devote years of research and over 500 closely
printed pages to disentangling the labyrinthine quarrels, blackmails,
machinations and correspondences which raged for so many years over
Byron's grave? The answer is, on one condition, that it is; the
condition being that one should have an appetite for detail and for
knowing as much as possible about one of the most dynamic geniuses who
ever lived.
<head>Leisured Mischief-Makers</head>
   <p>The evil that Byron did certainly lived after him, and was even
outmatched by the mischief perpetrated by almost every person who had
been close to him. In turning over the bones Doris Langley Moore has
brought to light a great deal of discreditable behaviour and a vision
of mischief-making propensities of the leisured classes in the early
19th century which leaves one a little breathless.
   <p>No previous Byron biographer, I fancy (and they have been many)
has had access at the same time to so many important manuscript
sources. The late Lady Wentworth, Byron's great-granddaughter, opened
the whole of the Lovelace Papers to Mrs. Moore in 1957; she was able
to continue her work on them for more than a year after Lady
Wentworth's death.
   <p>These papers, the contents of several trunks, are the accumulated
letters and personal documents left by Lady Byron, who never recovered
from the shock of her brief marriage with the poet, and dedicated the
rest of her life (she was 23 when they parted) to self-justification
and resentment.
   <p>Would that Byron's Memoirs had also survived! How the ghost of
the first John Murray must moan in his Albemarle Street vaults to
think how self-righteously, urged and abetted by Byron's lifelong
friend, John Cam Hobhouse, he burned them there in the fireplace,
condemning the work unread, as Tom Moore said, <quote>and without opening
it, as if it were a pest bag!</quote>
   <p>Byron's marriage, the reasons (real enough though embroidered
later) for Lady Byron's leaving him, the scandal of his love affair
with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, the question of the paternity of
Medora Leigh her daughter, the long inquisitorial persecution of
Augusta by Lady Byron (who seems to have been as neurotic as the most
ghoulish novelist could wish), the patient ferreting for evidence to
add homosexuality to incest as an extra nail in his coffin, the
unspeakable treacheries of Lady Caroline Lamb, the scarcely less
heinous treacheries of Augusta &mdash; it is the Lovelace Papers, surely,
that deserve to be called a <quote>pest bag</quote>, not Byron's consumed
Memoirs, which at least would have possessed the merit of being well
and entertainingly written.
   <p>Equally important have been the Hobhouse Journals, a vast mass of
material partly in the British Museum, partly in the possession of the
Hobhouse family in Somerset. Hobhouse, later Lord Broughton, was
Byron's intimate (if a little stuffy and unimaginative) friend from
their Cambridge days, who had travelled widely with him, been
fascinated by him to a point that looks like love, had fanned the
enthusiasm which had sent Byron finally to Greece, and suffered years
of loyal exasperation as Byron's executor.
<head>Sturdy Friends</head>
   <p>Byron as a man is seen at his best in relation to such sturdy
male friends. He brought out the worst in women, as they certainly
brought it out in him. There is scarcely a woman in his life besides
Teresa Guiccioli, last and most reasonable love, who does not affect
the modern reader with nausea.
   <p>The Countess Guiccioli was by birth a Gamba; her brother Pietro
accompanied Byron to Greece, shared the misery and ruinous
frustrations of the campaign, and was with him when he died. The
Gamba Papers in Ravenna have shed some valuable light on this last
phase, wholesomely contradicting the lies of that strangely theatrical
blackguard, Edward Trelawney, who played a highly discreditable part
in the Greek campaign himself, and wished, as did many others, to make
capital out of his association with Byron.
<head>A Modern Voice</head>
   <p>Few people come out of this detailed post-mortem with much
credit. Hobhouse certainly, though one respects him more than one
likes him, Byron himself, who, whenever his voice is heard above the
banshee wail (Augusta, Caroline Lamb, Lady Byron keeping in chorus)
surprises one by his tone of humanity, of common sense, of candour: a
startlingly modern voice. Lady Byron most dislikeable, Augusta a
shifty fool and not altogether a nice one, Lady Caroline Lamb a bitch
goddess in an age which (thanks to plentiful domestic service and
gracious living) was notably rich both in goddesses and bitches.

<text id=LOBC02>
<head>Masterpiece of horror</head>

   <p>AFTER ten days of intermittent, near fatal ennui, the
eleventh Berlin International Film Festival was suddenly jolted back
to life by two extraordinary films, Bernhard Wicki's <quote>Das Wunder
des Malachias</quote> (<quote>The Miracle of Father Malachias</quote>) and
Michaelangelo Antonioni's <quote>La Notte.</quote>
   <p>The number of German film directors who have made first rate
works in the last 25 years can be counted on the fingers of one hand:
Frank Wysbar (<quote>Fa"hrmann Maria</quote>), Helmut Ka"utner (<quote>Die
Grosse Freiheit No. 7</quote>), Herbert Selpin (<quote>Titanic</quote>), Wolfgang
Staudte (<quote>Rotation</quote>), and Georg Klaren (<quote>Wozzeck</quote>). It would
now seem that Wicki's name must be added to this list, for his new
film may well be a landmark in the revitalisation of the German
cinema.
   <p>Wicki is not only a director. He began his career as an actor,
had his first important film r&ocirc;le in Ka"utner's <quote>Die letzt
Bru"cke,</quote> and he also appears in the new Antonioni film. In 1950
he began to take photographs not only in Germany but also in Africa
and America. An exhibition of these works which is now on view in a
Berlin gallery is most impressive. As Friedrich Du"rrenmatt, the
Swiss playwright and author, wrote: <quote>Wicki's blacks and greys are
not only the colours of the lost and the forgotten, but they are also
the technical means of abstraction. Every unnecessary detail, all
superfluous local colouring must be eliminated. He does not want the
accuracy of a police photograph, but rather he wants to show the
eternal in every instant.</quote>
   <p>The chilling horror of <quote>Malachias</quote> is due as much to Wicki the
photographer as to Wicki the director. His earlier film, <quote>Die
Bru"cke,</quote> was equally terrifying, but here the director moves out
of the world of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum where the sun
never shines. Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
considerable fidelity, the film tells the story of a little monk who
prays that a disreputable night club near his church be removed. One
night his prayer is answered and the offending establishment is
suddenly transplanted to an island in the North Sea.
   <p>But Father Malachias's troubles have only begun. Instead of
having the desired effect, the miracle becomes exploited by a group of
shrewd newspapermen. Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of the
missing building. The Church rebukes the poor monk for his miracle,
and as a crowning indignity the night club is given a gala society
reopening on the island. Father Malachias goes to the island, prays,
and in a second miracle the night club is replaced in its original
setting.
   <p>A summary of the story can give almost no indication of the scope
of Wicki's artistry. He tells his story best in the faces of his
crowds, recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat with brutal honesty,
building up to a tremendous climax in the island orgy. Here, the
guests arrive in ghost-like yachts, the wildly flapping white sails
slashed by the glaring beacon of a lighthouse. When the final miracle
does occur, it is accepted as a marvellous joke; no one has learned
anything. Wicki suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue.
In complete silence he shows the faces of people walking in the
streets, smug, content, satisfied, and thoroughly frightening.
   <p>Wicki has succeeded in his second film in recording his personal
apocalypse of the last days of a sick society. It is most unfair to
call <quote>Malachias</quote> a cut-rate <quote>Dolce Vita,</quote> for it is far more
intimate and deeply felt. In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
in <quote>Titanic</quote> by paralleling the last days of the Third Reich with
the sinking of the great ocean liner, and paid for his audacity with
his life. To judge from the press, Wicki is to pay by being
journalistically crucified in his own country. Certainly there are
things wrong with the film, but the print arrived from the cutting
room only a few hours before its showing and could not be considered
in finished state. One can only hope that British audiences will have
a chance to judge this powerful creation for themselves in the near
future; <quote>Die Bru"cke</quote> is still waiting two years after its
German premi&egrave;re.
   <p><quote>La Notte</quote> will be shortly shown in London and for that
reason deserves shorter mention here. Those who feared that Antonioni
could never follow <quote>L'Avventura</quote> with another masterpiece can
rest easy; he has done the near impossible and turned out what
certainly must be one of the greatest studies of the renewal of love
that the screen has ever seen. Less obviously complex than his last
film, <quote>La Notte</quote> will undoubtedly have more popular appeal, but
this is in no way a reflection on its seriousness. His method of
painting with the camera has never been more exciting, exchanging the
rocks of Sicily for the skyscrapers of Milan. But his society is the
same, now even clearer, but touched with a melancholy compassion which
is a strong sign of the maturity of his ultimate artistic vision.
   <p>Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received the film with
extreme coolness, much preferring Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing
<quote>Une Femme est une Femme,</quote> a ninety-one minute hymn to
<quote>Vogue,</quote> <quote>Cahiers du Cinema,</quote> and the worst aspects of the
American cinema. From a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles out
into a series of repetitious sight-gags and personal jokes
incomprehensible to the uninitiated (including four plugs for Charles
Aznavour). Certainly one had the right to expect better. The other
French entry, Michel Drach's <quote>Am&eacute;lie, ou de Temps d'Aimer,</quote>
was late nineteenth-century French opera at its most beautiful, subtly
romantic with a twilight melancholy which lifted an involved story to
real heights.
   <p>As a refuge from the welter of mediocre features, the
retrospective shows are always of great interest, particularly the
programmes devoted to the works of Richard Oswald. This director is
at last being re-evaluated and given his proper place in the history
of the German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
<quote>Unheimliche Geschichten</quote> (1920), five ghost stories with a
light touch, and there was much to admire in <quote>Dreyfus</quote> (1930) and
the virtually unknown but extremely important <quote>1914</quote> (1931), which
tries to show that it took more than just Germany to start the First
World War.
   <p>Prizes being what they are, Berlin is unusually generous in
giving everyone something, and silver bears are awarded in every
direction. Both the Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours, and
the audience at the awards was particularly enthusiastic when one Miss
Anna Kerima was selected as best actress for her work in the Godard
film. Gifted with an interesting face, although little acting
ability, she would seem to be well worth watching in the months to
come.
<head>NEW FILMS</head>
<head>by Isabel Quigly</head>
   <p>FOR once a cinema's advertisement does not exaggerate. The
Academy advertises Jean-Luc Godard's A bout de Souffl&eacute;
(translated as Breathless, X certificate) as <quote>the most eagerly
awaited new film of the nouvelle vague,</quote> and although <quote>new</quote>
is hardly accurate (the film is two years old and one of those that
gave the new wave its original impetus and excitement), certainly the
film that <quote>Sight and Sound</quote> called <quote>the group's intellectual
manifesto</quote> is one that anyone with an interest in what the cinema is
up to has been waiting to see. Few films have been so widely
discussed before their public showing; and, as it turns out, few can
ever have seemed such obvious prototypes, or have embodied so many
attitudes and techniques that have since been imitated, exaggerated,
caricatured, and (therefore) weakened, even made absurd.
   <p>It is disappointing though perhaps inevitable that the young
directors of the new wave made their best films at the beginning, and
in most cases, far from going from strength to strength, have since
either repeated themselves or deteriorated or (generally) both; for
their great limitation is the lack, once they have made their original
point and asserted their independence of what went before them, of
anything much to say, and the fact that the world they deal with,
though at first it may look excitingly emancipated, is in fact as
restricted as that of drawing-room comedy. Its centre of gravity is
Paris, its inhabitants young people &mdash; students, spivs, petty crooks,
layabouts of every kind &mdash; all with a uniform sort (and style) of
sexual promiscuity and social aimlessness.
   <p>
   <p>HERE in London in 1961, we are seeing <quote>A bout de
Souffl&eacute;</quote> too late, of course, to feel its original impact, or
even its originality very forcefully: but even a short time ago it
must have seemed excitingly new, even revolutionary, one of the films
that, sick of the old guard's deadness, stageyness, and sheer lack of
film sense, started what was then an anti-clich&eacute; movement, a new
way of looking at the world. But there is a gloomy truth in the old
saws about revolutionaries turning into conservatives overnight: it is
not that they are bribed or bludgeoned by the establishment, but that
they turn into an establishment of their own. In no time at all their
very revolutionary qualities are copied, and appear quite dismally
hackneyed: what was once fresh and surprising becomes tricksy and
affected, and by now, in the case of the new wave, the movement is so
barnacled with its own clich&eacute;s that it is hard to remember the
high &mdash; inordinately high &mdash; hopes it began with.
   <p>Certainly <quote>A bout de Souffl&eacute;</quote> (which is almost a group
achievement: Godard directed, but Truffaut &mdash; <quote>Les 400 coups,</quote>
<quote>Shoot the pianist</quote> &mdash; wrote the script and Chabrol &mdash; <quote>The
cousins,</quote> <quote>Les bonnes femmes</quote> &mdash; was technical supervisor) is
extremely exciting, especially if you can forget what has come since.
It has now the familiar ingredients &mdash; a nihilistic attitude to
everything, wry, built-in jokes, a murderer-thief hero &mdash; but it has,
too, a startling freshness of style, a really surprising and
illuminating way of looking at objects, faces, people as they talk and
feel, conversations as they perform (or don't manage to perform) their
function of bringing people closer. It has a great look of speed and
technical fun about it, of enormous cinematic enjoyment, and above all
of cinematic sense. Much of it has that air of improvisation, as of
off-the-cuff living, that once seemed so new and so attractive. The
story (not that the story, in the sense of plot, matters much; but in
the sense of situation and movement it matters a lot) is that of a man
on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who spends a few days with an
American girl (Jean Seberg) who is bearing his child (though paternity
is always a rather dubious business among the new wave): an affair
that remains spiritually unconsummated as they move on to the final
betrayal.
   <p>
   <p>BELMONDO reappears at the Paris Pullman in Moderato
Cantabile (curiously translated into Seven Days... Seven Nights
... A certificate), Peter Brook's film made in France and shown last
autumn at the London Film Festival. In spite of magnificent
performances from him and from Jeanne Moreau, this has been fairly
well trounced by the critics wherever it has appeared. Leisurely,
even slow, rhythmically repetitive, the mysteriously simple story
takes place on the banks of the Garonne, which becomes an
unforgettable image. This is a very individual film, mannered,
subtle, literary, made by a man who is not necessarily a film-maker,
without the exclusively, ferociously cinematic eye of, say, Godard or
Truffaut; but, to me at least, strangely satisfying and memorable.
   <p>And for those who complain that Hollywood has grown too
sophisticated to turn out anything really amusingly bad these days,
anything like the old riproaring nonsenses in which Joan Crawford or
Lana Turner broke their hearts in black velvet and mink, there is
Parrish (director: Delmer Daves, A certificate: Warner), a
concoction as absurd as you could hope for, and a parody of every
family saga and regional-folksy film from giant downwards. With a
large blond youth of quite dazzling dumbness called Troy Donahue; and
Claudette Colbert, still charming amid the nonsense, and Karl Malden
not knowing how to take it, all rolling eyeballs like a villain from
East Lynne.

<text id=LOBC03>
<head>Film Virtues in A Taste of Honey</head>
<head>Mr. Richardson's Skilful Direction</head>
   <p>The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's play A Taste of
Honey opens at the Leicester Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been
produced and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also
part-author with Miss Delaney of the script, and the great advantages
to be derived from this unity of conception and control are everywhere
apparent.
   <p>This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived throughout in
terms of the cinema, and again and again it is the visual qualities of
the story, and the marriage of the central characters to their
background, which bring the film so vividly to life.
   <p>In Fanny, which also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to create the atmosphere of a
city. In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken a town in
the industrial North of England and has made it live. The shabby
streets and wet pavements, the school play-grounds, the public
monuments and the rubbish strewn canals &mdash; even the worn head-stones in
the churchyard, <quote>sacred to the memory of</quote> &mdash; are seen as an integral
part of the story. The background is always alive and always
changing; but the visual image is in keeping with the spoken word. We
accept implicitly that these characters have grown naturally and
inevitably from out of these surroundings.
   <p>Against this industrial setting Mr. Richardson has told Miss
Delaney's story. Its faults are still apparent. The plot is still
shapeless and inconclusive &mdash; indeed it is little more than an anecdote
of city life, with a beginning but no end &mdash; and the characters often
seem to lack consistency. But there is heart in the telling, and an
intense realism in the situation.
   <p>A young girl lives in a single dingy room with her slatternly,
promiscuous mother. In such surroundings she learns sex is something
sordid, and when she experiences it for the first time herself it is
incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and half inquisitively. As is
the case in Fanny her first lover is a sailor who leaves her to
bear his child and sails away. In Fanny the pregnant girl is
befriended by an old man. Here it is a young homosexual, estranged
from women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn
child as much as to the expectant mother, who acts as a protector and
comforter to her in her hour of need. He shares her room and gives
her his forlorn gift of companionship and sympathy &mdash; <quote>you need
someone to love you while you are looking for someone to love</quote>.
   <p>Miss Dora Bryan plays the mother as a flamboyant, down-to-earth
sensualist who lacks perception but is not altogether without heart.
Mr. Murray Melvin is the homosexual, his long lugubrious face
reflecting a hidden and unexpressed compassion.
   <p>Miss Rita Tushingham is the girl. It is always difficult when
assessing a moving and eloquent performance by a young and immature
screen actress to judge the extent to which her acting has been
inspired by skilled and sensitive direction. Mr. Richardson has
left his stamp so clearly on the rest of this film that some credit
must be given to him; but here is undeniably a performance of
surprising range and deep emotion, reflected in the face of an
ordinary schoolgirl that is seemingly without make-up but is
illuminated by a wonderful pair of eyes.
   <p>It is Mr. Richardson's great gift that he can show a face in
close-up and reveal the thoughts of the mind without a word being
spoken. This he does repeatedly in this film, especially with Miss
Tushingham.
<head>CONCERTOS ENLIVEN PROGRAMME</head>
   <p>Apart from Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture,
last night's Prom was entirely devoted to twentieth-century music,
with two piano concertos by Alan Rawsthorne and Prokofiev (each
composer's No. 1 in the medium) to enliven both halves of the
programme.
   <p>The two works are true bravura concertos lying within the grasp
only of players of virtuoso technique; they are alike, too, in placing
far more emphasis on crisply sparkling extravert brilliance than on
inwardness of feeling though admittedly Rawsthorne briefly becomes
more searching in his beautiful central chaconne. The soloist, Miss
Moura Lympany, could not have been better chosen, for she has the
clear-cut agility and vivacity of musicianship necessary for this kind
of music, and temperamentally does not suffer from any temptation to
delve more deeply into the notes than they warrant.
   <p>On their own, the B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra and Sir Malcolm
Sargent went to the rescue of <quote>Pohjola's Daughter</quote>, one of
Sibelius's offspring now very much on the shelf. This is vividly
scored but essentially naive programme music, perhaps more likely to
appeal on home ground where the Kalevala is as real as the Bible.
   <p>Sir Malcolm Sargent and the orchestra made every point with
graphic clarity, and almost the same was true of Vaughan Williams's
sixth symphony, which stood as the centrepiece of the programme. The
exception was the finale of the symphony, which was played just a
shade too fast and not quite insubstantially enough to convey the
full, hollow horror of its implications &mdash; the globe's vast desolation
after the extinction of all human life.
<head>Miss Dodie Smith Provides for Kitchen Sink</head>
<head>FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>LIVERPOOL, SEPT. 12.</head>
   <p>In her latest play, launched here last night, Miss Dodie Smith,
accepting the challenge of the times, has made room for a kitchen
sink. Its presence does nothing to sour these new arrivals among the
author's brood of brain children. Or should one call them heart
children? All their hearts are in the right place, and they run true
and sweet to family form.
   <p>There is even an older and more formidable challenge than the
sink itself to test their fundamental niceness, for this basement
kitchen of an old house in a London square is also the dining room of
a boarding establishment run by an amiable and fluttery spinster. All
her guests, whatever their age, lend a hand with the washing up (which
is frequent) with almost as much enjoyment as if at last some
miraculous detergent were being advertised in the live theatre.
   <p>No one is cantankerous, there are no petty jealousies or mutual
animosities. Who but Miss Dodie Smith would have thought boarding
house comedy could be written without them?
   <p>This boarding house has a pronounced list to stageward. It
accommodates young members of the profession and also a middle-aged
actor manqu&eacute; who has been out of touch with the world for 20 years
and is at first suspected of having been serving a prison sentence.
   <p>Actually he has been caring for his invalid but equally
histrionic wife who has died and left him free to fulfil, with her
blessing, his long thwarted ambition. When he has been gently
de-hammed for the modern stage by a young actress who is his
fellow-lodger he does land a contract. In the meanwhile we watch him
perform marvels of cooking and, generally at the same time, listen to
him delivering the most purple and familiar patches of Shakespeare.
   <p>There are a pair of pathetic fuddy-duddies who have parted with
their house because they have had <quote>a good offer</quote> for it, and a
hypochondriacal old bachelor who proposes to the gentle proprietress,
but is not accepted until she has made the surprising confession that
she, unlike her once suspected guest, has really been to prison.
   <p>This is Miss Smith's highest flight of imagination; the offence
was the absentminded theft of a library book for which in her youth
the otherwise innocent Miss Edie got 14 days without the option. The
inclusion of a titled <quote>char</quote> on the establishment is perhaps the
most deliberately modern touch.
   <p>Miss Jennifer Stirling plays Miss Edie with great skill and charm
and Mr. Willard Stoker effectively coordinates a good cast.
<head>Rare Acting in Betti Play</head>
<head>A Quietly Effective Production</head>
<head>Oxford Playhouse: Irene</head>

<head>Directed by BRYAN STONEHOUSE</head>
<head>FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</head>
<head>OXFORD, Sept. 12</head>
   <p>Irene is not perhaps one of Betti's masterpieces, but it is a
splendidly efficient play, constructed with sure instinct for
theatrical effect which never seemed to let this dramatist down.
   <p>The background is that rough, raw, savage land of southern Italy
which Betti explored in a number of plays. Here it is combined with
another theme dear to his heart, the workings of justice. A nice,
simple sergeant of the Carabinieri arrives in a strange village at
night to investigate some irregularities concerning the town clerk.
By chance he lights first of all upon the clerk's house, stays there
for the night and becomes disturbingly involved with the clerk, his
faded, pretentious wife and, particularly, his beautiful crippled
daughter, Irene.
   <p>The next morning he hears the evidence against his erstwhile
host, and learns of the bitter enmity in which the mayor and the rest
hold him. Where does the truth lie? How far can the sergeant, caught
between his feelings for Irene and her family on the one hand and the
evidence and the veiled blackmail of the mayor on the other reach a
fair and unbiased decision?
   <p>Especially when he learns that the girl, whom he believed pure
and innocent, is in fact the local prostitute. Despite this she still
retains a strange innocence, somewhere between that of the idiot and
that of the saint, which sets up violent and contradictory emotions in
those who visit her as well as in the sergeant: they want her to go
and yet they want her to stay; he does not know until almost too late
whether he loves her or loathes her.
   <p>Arguably, the dramatist has committed a technical error in
allowing Irene to speak for herself; we would be altogether clearer in
our minds about her if she remained a flawed but beautiful enigma,
seen but not heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her few
brief scenes effective, and Mr. Dinsdale Landen, in the longest and
most exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a performance of rare
intelligence and restrained power. Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's
production is quietly effective, giving full value to the formal
elements of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing them.
<head>A MORALITY PLAY ON AMBITION</head>
   <p>Last night's play in the <quote>Play of the Week</quote> series on
independent television, Then We Fall, by Mr. Paul Ferris, was a
morality on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive power of
unbridled ambition. It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most
treatments of its subject by attempting to generate a melodramatic
inevitability which left its central character and the world around
him in complete, unredeemable desolation.
   <p>We could, perhaps, say whether or not the attempt succeeded if we
had a little more faith in the way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated
his characters. Mervyn Morris abandons his job as a pilot in a Welsh
seaport, finds a position with the local paper, treads underfoot
everyone, especially his wife, with whom he deals: his wife leaves him
for the paper's shy, gentle editor. At which he prevails upon his
father-in-law, a miserly, fanatical Welsh nationalist, to murder the
editor for him. No suspicions are aroused but no problems are solved
for he loses his job because, at the moment of the murder, he is
standing in front of television cameras and, with his nerves on edge,
talking tactlessly.
   <p>Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensitively pushing,
Miss Sheila Allen his wife, always palely appealing, Mr. James
Maxwell, the editor, always comically abashed by the events, and Mr.
Aubrey Richards, the father-in-law, always comically grotesque; they
were not asked to modulate from their set moods but played with proper
efficiency and, in the case of Mr. Richards, with lavish and
suitably gaudy colour. Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
explicably from appreciable motives. The rest, one feels, were driven
to effective action by the author in spite of the ineffectuality with
which he had endowed them. One hopes that he is not asking us to
believe that, because of their odd accents, they act oddly like the
queer foreigners of tradition.

<text id=LOBC04>
<head>FRANKLY, IT'S NOT FOR FRANKIE...</head>
   <p>NEXT month that friendly, effervescent performer Frankie
Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage in a new show.
   <p>To paraphrase his well-known ditty: <quote>He'll have the
limelight, they'll give him the girls &mdash; and leave the rest to him.</quote>
   <p>I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the old,
star-studded West End than he will ever feel in Hollywood.
   <p>His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have recently given
Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet treatment.
   <p>But they haven't done a thing for his film career that Anna
Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not doing better here, before the
platinum-plated Hollywood carrot was dangled before his nose.
   <p>In his first Hollywood picture, <quote>Let's Make Love,</quote> he was
swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand. Against
this couple Frankie, in a cardboard role, didn't stand a chance.
   <p>Now comes <quote>The Right Approach</quote> (Rialto, <quote>A</quote>), and it's
a glum business.
   <p>He plays an aspiring actor &mdash; a selfish, arrogant, brash,
ambitious, unscrupulous heel &mdash; who would tread on anybody's neck to
get a break in the Hollywood ratrace.
<head>Cynical</head>
   <p>He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives, cheats a
waitress (Juliet Prowse) and cynically uses a magazine editress
(Martha Hyer) to get ahead.
   <p>Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite true as a
smooth-tongued, ill-mannered Yank.
   <p>His best moments are when he swings breezily into the title
song. But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go for a new hit song.
   <p>He might be well advised to think hard and long before his next
jump into the Hollywood arena.
   <p>VERDICT: Vaughan should have by-passed this approach.
   <p>
   <p>RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
Hollywood treatment, thanks to a sound performance in <quote>Taste of
Fear</quote> (Warner Theatre, <quote>X</quote>).
   <p>He has earned his break.
   <p>The film is a well-made variation on that sinister yarn in
which half the cast try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her
mind.
   <p>Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is built up
neatly.
   <p>Susan Strasberg is the crippled damsel in distress.
   <p>Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are also
effectively around.
   <p>They provide some chilly red herrings in this <quote>Find-the-body</quote>
thriller.
   <p>VERDICT: Don't believe all you see and hear!
   <p>
   <p>NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney James has
pumped life into a slim, strained comedy.
   <p>He does his rescue act in <quote>Double Bunk</quote> (Leicester-square
Theatre, <quote>A</quote>).
<head>Strength</head>
   <p>Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when newly-weds Ian
Carmichael and Janette Scott let loose their ancient houseboat on a
honeymoon trip down the river.
   <p>The film starts off brightly enough but, half-way through, the
plot (as well as the boat) springs a near-disastrous leak.
   <p>Familiar members of Britain's repertory team of comedy
character-actors jump through equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.
   <p>VERDICT: The <quote>bunk</quote> needed doubling.
<head>DONALD <squote>TAKES</squote> THE EVENING</head>
<head>LAST NIGHT'S T V</head>
<head>by CLIFFORD DAVIS</head>
   <p>DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's <quote>Drama
'61</quote> last night as a smooth, scheming jewel thief in a play by
Jacques Gillies, <quote>The Takers.</quote>
   <p>A polished production by Quentin Lawrence, here, held together
by Mr. Houston's accomplished performance as the master mind behind
a gang of crooks.
   <p>This plot to rob a French millionaire of &pound;300,000 worth of
jewellery struck me as ingenious. The play had style, moved at a
quick pace and everyone did well.
   <p>But it was Mr. Houston's evening.
   <p>Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley Holloway's act too
long and not particularly entertaining.
   <p>It was also a mistake to re-book Gene Detroy and his performing
chimpanzees so soon after their previous appearance.
   <p>Their offering last night differed little from their earlier act
on this show a week or so ago. But the Mudlarks, with Jeff Mudd out
of the Army and back with sister Mary and brother Fred, were in
bright, zestful form.
   <p>Why only two numbers, though? It was not enough.
<head>A Rix mix</head>
<head>by RICHARD SEAR</head>
   <p><quote>A FAIR COP,</quote> the B B C Whitehall farce last night,
looked like a rabbit warren in a field of corn.
   <p>I can't recall a production where so many comics bolted in and
out of holes so often.
   <p>The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old lot &mdash; this time Brian
Rix lost his skirt instead of his trousers.
   <p>The action moved at tremendous speed, backed by some wonderful
timing by the cast.
   <p>I especially liked the tea-cup scene where six of the cast
changed cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
   <p>Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble as Smiler Perkins
were the most laughable.
   <p>They alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut through the
gormless standing corn around them. Perhaps it was accidental &mdash; I
hope not.
   <p>If ever a bag of humour needed a thorough shaking up the
Whitehall farce is it when it comes to television.
<head>IT'S AN OLD PIANNA PIN-UP</head>
<head>ON THE RECORD</head>
<head>by Patrick Doncaster</head>
   <p>HOW do you get on records? Well, you've got to have
something different.
   <p>Sing slightly flat. All the good singers sing in tune.
   <p>Twang a guitar slightly off key. Everybody's fed up with the
right way &mdash; so the best-seller charts say. Play an OLD pianna
instead of a new one.
   <p>You got to get it into your head, son... people don't like
things as they should be &mdash; not on record, anyway.
   <p>Thus, musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred disc
solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out A PACKET OF
DRAWING-PINS.
   <p><quote>Why not,</quote> thought ex-soldier Mr. Lisbon, who is
twenty-three, and lives in Dagenham, Essex, <quote>press a thumb-tack into
the nose of the hammers that strike the piano strings?</quote>
   <p>He did, on his piano at home. There weren't enough tacks and he
got only the middle hammers done.
   <p>Then he tried it out for sound.
   <p>Um-chink... um-chink... it went. Slightly flat and jangly in
part. DELIGHTFUL!
   <p>He put the sound on tape. The tape went to the Philips
company.
   <p>Within two days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract. And they
hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen miles to London for his
first session.
   <p>Now along comes his solo disc, featuring two of his own
compositions, <quote>Deerstalker</quote> and <quote>Almost Grown Up.</quote>
   <p>VERDICT: Mr. Lisbon has it taped. And tacked.
   <p>And he says: <quote>Just as well I had only one box of tacks &mdash; it
might have been so different....</quote>
   <p>More news from the ivory-thumping dept.... Russ Conway,
who has tinkled his way to fame on an old pianna, comes in with
another of his own works: <quote>Parade of the Poppets</quote> (Columbia).
   <p>But not one of his nimble-fingered best.
<head>CUTE</head>
   <p>GERMANY'S Russ Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY
OTTO. But nothing crazy about his pianistics.
   <p>He pounds merrily away at a piece called <quote>Piccadilly</quote>
(Polydor). I find it cute.
   <p>American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on <quote>It's
Now or Never,</quote> looks like having a success on his own with <quote>On the
Rebound</quote> (RCA).
   <p>
   <p>NEW boy on the vocal front is Rolly Daniels, who comes
5,000 miles from India to seek disc fame.
   <p>Comedian Hal Monty saw him in Bombay, became his manager. And
such is Hal's faith that he brings him to Europe.
   <p>Now Rolly gets his big break &mdash; a record, the modern Aladdin's
lamp of show business. Become a success with a disc and hey presto!
You're a star....
   <p>Rolly sings with assuredness <quote>Bella Bella Marie</quote>
(Parlophone), a lively song that changes tempo mid-way.
   <p>I don't think he will storm the charts with this one, but it's a
good start.
   <p>
   <p>CHRIS CHARLES, 39, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees, is an
accountant. He is also a director of a couple of garages.
   <p>And he finds time as well to be a lyric writer.
<head>OBLIGED</head>
   <p>He writes with Tolchard Evans, composer of <quote>Lady of
Spain</quote> and other big hits.
   <p>Tolch, as he is known in Tin Pan Alley, likes songs with a month

<head>LAST NIGHT'S TV</head>
<head>The soldier who was scared</head>
<head>by RICHARD SEAR</head>
   <p>ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding success last night in
I T V's <quote>Private Potter,</quote> his first big T V part.
   <p>The play was a brilliantly-written essay on soldiering which
stated that a fighting man could only be regarded as a machine.
   <p>Potter screamed during an action, and was arrested. He claimed
he had seen a vision of God &mdash; only the padre and his C O believed
him.
   <p>Courtenay played the part with a gawky, Northern defiance. The
cameras played continuously on his craggy face, and obstinate, baffled
eyes. They stripped him of his ugly battle-dress, to leave him for
what he was &mdash; Potter, a frightened boy who had a vision.
   <p>It was a splendid interpretation of the part.
   <p>The rest of the cast were well chosen, with James Maxwell
making a fine job of the sympathetic C O.
<head>IMPOSSIBLE? &mdash; NO!</head>
   <p>Paul Daneman gave another first-class performance last night as
a wartime naval officer in the B B C's <quote>The Little Key.</quote>
   <p>The play was no more than a figment of the imagination which
asked the viewer to believe in a beautiful ghost. It would have been
an impossible piece of television but for clever production by Michael
Hayes.
   <p>He captured the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great effect.

   <p>The film covered a wide aspect of the British scene, ranging from

   <p>Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked education.
   <p>It was left to reporter Sevareid to make the strongest
criticisms. He said that in the race of the modern nations, Britain
was slipping behind....

<head>Fine Classical Chorus</head>
<head>Imparting Ritual Significance</head>
   <p>Scala Theatre: The Choephori.
   <p>Though Mr. Dimitrios Rondiris's ideas about the use of
material from folksong and folkdance in accommodating a classical
chorus to the modern stage had some chances of expression in his
production of the Sophocles Electra last week, the real test comes
with the Aeschylian equivalent, The Choephori, and its tailpiece,
The Eumenides, which make up the second programme of the Greek
Tragedy Theatre's season.
   <p>For the role of the chorus here is much more important and
active, particularly in The Eumenides, than it ever is in
Sophocles, and the ritual element in the drama, always a stumbling
block for modern audiences, is much closer to the surface. In the
first play the chorus are embodiments of right judgment in the
abstract, applying the tests of religion to the situations before them
and urging the characters to the proper actions even when these, mere
individual human beings, may be torn by doubt.
   <p>In the second they become the Furies, the embodiments of one
aspect of the divine vengeance, which pursues the slayer of his own
kind, even if that slaughter was divinely ordained, and finally the
impersonal prophets of universal reconciliation.
   <p>Mr. Rondiris's handling of the chorus here is masterly
throughout: in The Choephori they still perform the function of
sympathetic decor, as in Electra, but if anything with more
subtlety and control, and when their measured speech passes over into
song the tones are, remotely but unmistakably, those taught by the
Orthodox liturgy &mdash; the readiest way of imparting ritual significance
to their words for a modern audience.
   <p>In The Eumenides they are different again; as the Furies
pursuing Orestes they take a direct part in the action, and are thus
required to project emotions of their own instead of merely reflecting
the emotions of the central characters. Savage and weirdly masked,
they swirl in a turbulent mass about the stage, eschewing until the
very end the regular, balanced compositions of the earlier play.
   <p>The human beings involved in the intricate working out of divine
justice are relatively less important than in later Greek tragedy, but
they are strongly played by actors with whom we are already familiar
from Electra. The protagonist in both plays is Orestes, and Mr.
D. Veakis has more chance than he had in the Sophocles to win us
over to his rather exaggerated style of acting, though he still does
not quite succeed.
   <p>The Electra and Clytemnestra of this earlier production have
changed places this time (presumably so that Miss Aspassia
Papathanassiou could appear in both plays, as Clytemnestra and her
ghost). Miss Thalia Kalliga's Electra is as impressive as her
Clytemnestra, but inevitably Miss Papathanassiou with her incandescent
pallor and the vibrant intensity of her stage presence seizes our
attention every moment she is on the scene and it is a measure of her
power over the whole production that when the curtain finally descends
it is not the harmony of the close, but Clytemnestra's ghost crying in
the night for vengeance, which remains most potently in our minds.
<head>FINE EXHIBITION OF SPORTING PRINTS</head>
<head>AGE OF THE COLOURED AQUATINT</head>
   <p>The exhibition of English and French engravings of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries at Messrs. Agnew's Galleries,
43, Old Bond Street, until July 8, is a pleasant reminder mainly of
the age of the coloured aquatint though it includes also examples of
the delicate French line-engravings after Moreau \le Jeune from Le
Monument de Costume.
   <p>It represents in impressions of excellent quality such famous
prints as Debucourt's <quote>La Promenade Publique</quote> of 1792, the view
of Westminster Hall and Abbey engraved by D. Havell after J.
Glendall, and the now rare coaching subjects of James Pollard of which
<quote>The Royal Mails preparing to start for the West of England, 1831</quote>
(from the <quote>Swan with Two Necks</quote>, Cheapside) is a notable example.
Joseph Farington gains from translation into aquatint in the plates
from Boydell's <quote>History of the River Thames</quote> and some interesting
views of early nineteenth century Greece include an aquatint of the
Parthenon (Dodwell-Bennett) as it must have appeared shortly after
Lord Elgin had removed the <quote>Marbles</quote>. The sporting prints by
Herring and Alken are good examples of an always popular genre.
<head>PICTORIAL CONFECTIONS</head>
   <p>Closely alike in style, the pictures of Dietz Edzard and
Suzanne Eisendieck may be suitably described as <quote>confections</quote> and
the sugared quality the word implies pervades the current exhibition
of their work at the Adams Gallery, 24, Davis Street, W.1,
giving to views of Venice and Normandy a charm curiously remote from
reality. The idyllic combination of figure and landscape in which
these artists have specialized needs a sweet tooth of appreciation.
The exhibition continues until June 30.
<head>Moral Earnestness in Ballet</head>
   <p>The social and aesthetic climate of Soviet ballet is so
different from our own that in considering Russian ballet today we
start at a considerable disadvantage. The sense of moral earnestness,
the view that art should be a guide and mentor for the people, which
is the substructure of Soviet choreography, can produce effects which
will strike us as naive or old-fashioned; yet this would not perhaps
be so important were it not for the fact that the use made of dance
movement and of performers must necessarily reflect this same feeling.
   <p>The choreographic manner &mdash; where the hero's leaps are an
affirmation of faith, and the heroine, held aloft, is woman-kind as a
triumphant inspiration and reward for the hero's endeavours &mdash; has an
initial excitement which too often declines into dramatic clich&eacute;,
to the detriment of our western enjoyment of the dancing as a stage
spectacle.
   <p>These are the very faults of The Stone Flower with which the
Leningrad State Kirov Ballet opened their season at Covent Garden last
night. The plot tells of a stone-cutter, Danila, loving a young girl,
Katerina, and dissatisfied with his art. His longing to create a
perfect stone flower takes him to a magical cavern, presided over by
the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. There he learns the secrets of
his craft, and there Katerina comes at last to fetch him away from the
Mistress of the Mountain, who reluctantly lets him go.
   <p>It is, baldly, an uneven work, but even in our limited experience
of Soviet ballet, an interesting one, and an unusual departure from
anything we have seen previously from Russia. Gone is the realist
d&eacute;cor; instead, a back drop rises to reveal the various changes for
scenes which are otherwise played on a bare stage and with simple
black wings.
   <p>The choreography is the first major creation of the young Yuri
Grigorovich, and it demonstrates a talent not as yet up to the demands
of a large work. For Danila and Katerina he uses a free-flowering
classicism, while for the Mistress of the Mountain he has devised a
quasi-acrobatic style, sinuous, angular, and very brilliant. He is
most successful in adapting folk-dancing for the chorus of peasants
and gipsies, and he shows a remarkable gift for movement for a large
corps, dazzling, intricate, and with a muscular brio that is
enormously effective. But against this we have to set scenes for the
corps de ballet of jewels that seem fidgety and sterile exercises
in academic movement, lacking any originality.
   <p>The three principals are admirable: as Danila, Mr. Yuri
Soloviev gives a tremendous performance; he has a prodigious technique
in leaps and turns, he is a fine partner, and conveys that sense of
dramatic conviction that can disarm our criticism of a character that
is not fully explored in the ballet. As Katerina and the Mistress of
the Mountain Miss Alla Sizova and Miss Alla Osipenko are well
contrasted, with Miss Sizova's warm lyrical style matched against the
force and &eacute;clat of Miss Osipenko.
   <p>The company are seen best in the character dances; as peasants
and gypsies in a fair scene that inevitably recalls Petrushka they
show just how much dramatic variety can be obtained from a superb
corps. In the <quote>classical</quote> sequences we can only appreciate the
difference that still exists between Leningrad and Moscow dancers;
here is a style that seems nearer our own, more reserved and less
emotionally extreme than the Bolshoi.
   <p>The Prokofiev score, magnificently handled by Mr. Niazi, is
adequate as ballet music, but a first hearing does not reveal it as of
the standard of Romeo and Juliet, or even as appealing as
Cinderella.
<head>WIDE COLOUR ON HARPSICHORD</head>
<head>MISS SILVIA KIND'S RECITAL</head>
   <p>In spite of the harpsichord's popularity, true harpsichordists
these days are very rare. Miss Silvia Kind, who played a varied and
consistently interesting programme at Wigmore Hall last night, can
hardly be considered one just yet.
   <p>An attack of nerves in Bach's Italian Concerto caused her to take
the outer movements at perilously fast tempi with scarcely a thought
for any detailed phrasing of their melodic lines; if at the start of a
recital this could be forgiven, her reliance on colour effects to
underline the structure of the music &mdash; which unfortunately persisted
throughout much of the remainder of it &mdash; most certainly could not.
The expressive powers of a harpsichord are by no means directly
proportionate to the number of registrations it possesses.
   <p>In some seventeenth-century programme pieces by John Bull,
Bernardo Pasquini and Alessandro Poglietti the employment of a wide
variety of colour per se seemed appropriate enough; in
Mozart, however (the Duport variations K.573), such superficial
treatment chopped up the music altogether too much.
   <p>But the performance of Bach's D major Toccata BWV 912, with
which Miss Kind ended her recital, combined some splendidly bold and
free declamatory playing with keen perception of the work's continuity
and nobility of outline. It suggested, in fact, that Miss Kind is a
very much better harpsichordist than this recital as a whole revealed.
<head>UNEQUAL SUPPORT FOR THREE AUTHORS</head>
   <p>Webber-Douglas School: Triple Bill
   <p>Thirteen second-year students appeared in last night's
performance, and one's judgment of them might have been fairer, if the
running order of the programme had been reversed. As it was, their
failure to make the first two items work as play, was irritating, and
caused one to undervalue even those pieces of acting which obviously
had merit, such as those of Miss Jocelyn Carney in Act 1 of The
Chalk Garden and of all three players in A Phoenix Too Frequent,
Miss Amanda Reeves, Miss Sonia Hughes, and Mr. Aart \van Bergen.
   <p>The cast of the third piece, The Dark Lady of the Sonnets,
did not reach a noticeably higher standard than that of Mr.
Christopher Fry's play, yet the former, consisting of Mr. Gerald
Curtis (Shakespeare), Miss Gabrielle Griffin (Queen Elizabeth 1),
Miss Hazel Prance and Mr. Gilbert Sutherland, seemed to have no
trouble in persuading us to take Shaw's 50-year-old plea for a
National Theatre in excellent part.
   <p>The movement at the beginning when the Tudor Beefeater made the
same damning criticism of Shakespeare's play that people were still
making of Shaw's plays in 1910 was such a delight that we were
prepared from then onwards to be satisfied with everything. But to
accept so much help from Shaw and themselves to give so little help to
their other two authors, Miss Enid Bagnold and Mr. Fry, looked like
weakness in this student company.
<head>Zurich Sees Two Contrasting Versions of Dostoevsky's Crime and
Punishment</head>
<head>FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</head>
   <p>Two stage versions of Raskolnikoff have been presented here
in Zurich during the June Festival. Leopold Ahlsen's play was brought
to the Schauspielhaus in the production of the Berlin
Schlosspark-theater and Heinrich Sutermeister's opera is in the
season's repertory of the Stadtheater. Seen here on consecutive days
these two adaptations of Dostoevsky's novel seem as different from
each other &mdash; and in many ways from the book itself &mdash; as current
opinions on crime and punishment are sometimes at variance.
   <p>Mr. Ahlsen's play might well have been given the alternative
title of <quote>Crime and Detection</quote>, and derives much of its dramatic
impetus from being a good thriller. But it goes deeper than that,
too. It is a fascinating psychological study and draws some attention
to the political, metaphysical, religious, and moral aspects of the
subject under discussion, namely, the taking of human life.

<head>THE NEW BOOKS</head>
<head>BEHAN BESTOWS AN ACCOLADE ON DELANEY</head>
<head>She's the flower in a cultural desert, he says</head>
   <p>IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday. The streets are
tranquilly sunny and still, for the town is at Mass. Most of it. In
the front room of a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who never
actually got to church, but who are gathered with devotion around
Brendan Behan and a brandy bottle.
   <p>Where the bhoys are. In the hallway are the empties; through
the door hearts are full, hopes are high. There are still a few amber
inches in the bottle.
   <p>Present are some hard-core Friends of Brendan. They listen with
many an obliging guffaw to the brandy owner's solo swish on his
anecdotal roller-coaster, with occasional stops for an old I.R.A.
air or a Connemara tear-jerker.
<head>Pluckily</head>
   <p>ALSO present is a London journalist who arrived two hours
earlier by appointment to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
The Hostage about his new work, if any, and who is now being
pluckily convivial to fight off the frustration.
   <p>The telephone has rung a couple of times, calls from other chums
sniffing the wind and offering to drop by for a chat.
   <p>At last Brendan &mdash; to the journalist's relief &mdash; turns his
attention to the writing scene. He proceeds to place himself in the
literary hierarchy.
   <p><quote>I consider myself,</quote> he says, <quote>a cut above Evelyn Waugh
socially, a cut above Nancy Mitford artistically, a cut above Frank
Haxell conversationally.
   <p><quote>But,</quote> he continues, <quote>the greatest is Shelagh Delaney. Just
because A Taste of Honey was set in Salford they put on her the
limiting label of working-class writer. That's as bloody silly as
calling a Rolls-Royce a type of transport. She's the flower in a
cultural desert.
   <p><quote>Now, me &mdash; I'm a journalist, I write to entertain rather than
educate. And I don't write at all unless I'm exceedingly skint.
   <p><quote>But I'll say this. I'd like to live in America and do some
writing there. It's a very free place to write in, and there's the
advantage that no one knows what you're writing about anyway.
   <p><quote>Not that I did much when I was over this past two times, not
with that great little Irish bar on Seventh Avenue, The Pigsty, always
open. I was there, in even faster orbit, when that third astronaut
went up &mdash; what's his name? I'm the only man on earth who doesn't know
what his name is. Don't tell me. I want to preserve that
distinction.
   <p><quote>I already know about Shepard and that Salvation Army chap
Gagarin &mdash; the two biggest bores since Cardinal Newman. That's enough
of all that hooey.</quote>
<head>Gravely</head>
   <p>HE plunges on into reminiscences of his trips. There is
much to recall.
   <p>Among other incidents he was banned from New York's St.
Patrick's Day parade as a <quote>disorderly person.</quote>
   <p>He was in a fight after telling a Canadian, during a chat about
space-flight: <quote>Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit, Israel will
put a matzo ball into orbit, and Lichtenstein will put a postage stamp
into orbit before you Canadians put up a mouse.</quote>
   <p>And he suffered an alcoholic seizure and was gravely ill in
hospital with a diabetic and heart condition.
   <p>His return to Dublin was heralded by the announcement that he was
<quote>off the gargle &mdash; a retired alcoholic.</quote> Since then he has been
heard of often in the newspapers &mdash; three times up before the beaks for
drunk and disorderly conduct.
<head>Partially</head>
   <p>LESS has been heard of Brendan's work. It is now five
years since his first play, The Quare Fellow, was produced, three
years since Borstal Boy was published and The Hostage was put
on.
   <p>What has happened to the play, Richard's Cork Leg, begun 18
months ago and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal, Stratford,
last spring? It was never finished.
   <p>What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded by his
publishers in March of last year? Still a skeleton.
   <p>Yet I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of a book
planned to be called Confessions of an Irish Rebel which was
delivered to his agents in June.
<head>Zestfully</head>
   <p>IT begins: <quote>There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's
return from her abortion in Bristol.</quote> It is ribald, funny,
brilliantly observant of character, and authentic as a glass of
draught porter.
   <p>But will we see its end? The last scene of this fragment is in a
pub where the author throws a &pound;10 note on to the bar and orders a
round for the pals, one of whom cries: <quote>Now aren't you the great
sport, though, Brendan Behan!</quote>
   <p>It is apparently praise that is still so important to him that he
lets his talent drown &mdash; for not very deep under the histrionics of
having a zest for life must be a great fear of living.
<head>BOOKS IN BRIEF</head>
   <p>STEPHEN MORRIS, by Nevil Shute (Heinemann, 16s.). This
first attempt at novel writing &mdash; two unpublished stories from the
'20s &mdash; is the last work we shall see of the late Nevil Shute. It will
interest devotees, but, despite the accurate flying-lore and natural
story-telling skill, it is a creaky piece of apprenticeship.
   <p>L. S. LOWRY (Studio books, 21s.). The Painters of
Today series issues this attractive collection of the work of perhaps
the most fascinating artist in Britain today &mdash; the Lancastrian who
does those vivid crowded dream pictures of the industrial scene.
There is a warm and illuminating monograph by Mervyn Levy.
   <p>PULL MY DAISY (Evergreen Books, 10s. 6d.). Jack
Kerouac's ad-libbed text for the beat film made in a Bowery flat by
Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie, with stills of the strolling players,
including Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso. It reads like a demented
kind of litany &mdash; the American free-livers doing what comes naturally,
and with the beat between their teeth.
<head>EVE PERRICK</head>
<head>THE NEW FILMS</head>
<head>\La Lollo and the hockey girl bully-off</head>
   <p>I AM happy to report that I saw something this week I have
never before witnessed, either in pictures or outside &mdash; a budgerigar
playing a drunk scene, and playing it with perfect timing and
technique.
   <p>It gives one loud, clear hiccup and falls flat on its back.
   <p>This brilliant budge, I may add, gets no credit in the cast list
of Come September (Odeon, Leicester-square), which suggests that
it is either using a stand-in for the stunt stuff or needs a more
pushful personal manager.
   <p>The performance of our talented feathered friend is not the only
good thing (although the one original touch) in the film, which is
better-than-average glossy comedy, Hollywood-styled, European set.
   <p>Most of it has been shot in and around the sun-terrace of the
Hotel Splendido (renamed the Dolce Vista for the picture) in
Portofino &mdash; and if there's a better view to be had from a more
comfortable vantage point anywhere, I'd like to see it.
<head>NIGHTIES</head>
   <p>It also parades Gina Lollobrigida in a selection of
neglig&eacute;e-and-nightie ensembles not too well designed for sleeping
in, and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver Rolls-Royce.
   <p>Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each September
in his Italian villa and the company of Signorina Lollobrigida.
   <p>In the holiday seasonal months before and after this annual idyll
his major-domo (Walter Slezak at his most nauseating) turns the
palazzo into a luxury hotel.
   <p>Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks
with tradition and arrives there in July, when, just as inevitably,
the place is full of American teenagers on an escorted tour.
   <p>Result: Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find themselves playing
chaperon (Brenda \de Banzie, the official one, has broken a leg) to
the girls, who have just been joined by a Jeep-load of boys.
   <p>It's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle, but I don't
think it was through boredom.
   <p>The film is funny enough in places and has a line or two of
painful home truths thrown in.

   <p>Of course Mr. Hudson can take one more hill than the
youngsters. So all ends as you know it will, with the middle-aged
romancers respectably wed and Master Darin going steady with the
delectable Sandra Dee (to whom, I believe, he is married in real
life).
   <p>Miss Dee, incidentally, who keeps turning up as the typical
teenager in all the <quote>good girl</quote> parts (Tuesday Weld gets the <quote>bad
girl</quote> ones), is becoming quite an accomplished actress.
<head>STUDIES</head>
   <p>THE Marriage-Go-Round (Carlton) is also a comedy of
manners, but fun-films toting an X certificate have to keep a sharp
look-out that the jokes about sex (what else would they joke about
with an X?) are of the witty, verbal variety and not the visual
slapstick.
   <p>This has only one gag &mdash; that of the entry of a gladiator (female,
7ft. high, <squote>stacked</squote> and Scandinavian) into the cosy but
unbelievably elegant household of a pair of married college
professors.
   <p>The girl is a knock-out (see picture of Julie Newmar for
confirmation). She also has quite a mission in mind.
   <p>She, <quote>younger, prettier, stronger, and more intelligent</quote> than
the wife (as she soon tells her), wants to have the perfect baby. And
she has chosen the husband (James Mason), who is an academic friend of
her Nobel prize-winning father to be Big Daddy.
   <p>This sort of situation calls for some subtle, slightly sardonic
handling. It doesn't get it.
   <p>But The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of time. I
learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced Studies attached to
some American universities the subject Social Psychology used to be
called Home-making and is now known as Domestic Relations.
   <p>Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply and sweetly. Mason is
always good for a glower. And Miss Newmar is a stunner in every sense
of the word.
   <p>According to the script she was once captain of the junior hockey
team at her school. So help me so was I.
<head>ESSAYS</head>
   <p>IL GRIDO (The Cry) &mdash; Paris Pullman &mdash; is an earlier essay
in atmospheric meandering by the L'Avventura man, Michelangelo
Antonioni.
   <p>In it Steve Cochran, deserted by Alida Valli, roams the Pontine
Marshes, alternately enjoying the hospitality of three lonely,
sex-starved women, before returning home.
   <p>Whereupon he climbs to the top of the tower in the sugar-beet
refinery, suffers an unexplained attack of vertigo and falls to his
death.
   <p>Maybe this is a masterpiece, too. I just wouldn't know.

   <p>A FEW minutes later the father gripping a loaded rifle, told
his wife: <quote>Anne, they have stolen our baby.</quote>
   <p>It was not only their baby &mdash; it was America's. The grief of the
young parents became a national agony that erupted into hysteria when
nine weeks later the child of Charles Lindbergh, hero aviator and
golden boy, was found murdered. Kidnap, by George Waller (out
today, Hamish Hamilton 30s.), is a painstaking, meticulous account
of the most notorious and publicised crime of the 30's.
   <p>The plain, sober manner of its style all the more tellingly
points up not only the horror of the case itself, which floundered on
to the electrocution four years later of a German-born Bronx carpenter
named Bruno Richard Hauptmann, but to the raree-show emotionalism and
sensation-hunger of that era.

<head>TOULOUSE-LAUTREC AT THE TATE</head>

<head>Vigour and Decay</head>
<head>By David Sylvester</head>
<head>An exhibition of paintings and drawings by Toulouse-Lautrec,
organised by the Arts Council, opened at the Tate Gallery on Friday.</head>
   <p>LAUTREC'S liking for whores and dancers and singers and
acrobats as subjects was, of course, a perfectly commonplace taste
among artists of his time. What is singular about his use of them is
that no other artist, of his time or any other, has painted them so
directly, intimately and pertinently.
   <p>He doesn't, on the one hand, use them as symbols, pegs for a
moral or aesthetic attitude, as the young Picasso does (to take one
example among many); and on the other hand, he doesn't use them only
for the way they look, like Degas, whose dancers are more or less
interchangeable with his laundrywomen &mdash; the same breed with a
different set of gestures. He is concerned with them as they are and
also for what they are.
<head>The artist and his obsessions</head>
   <p>This can't be explained away by his extreme personal
involvement with them. Artists don't necessarily bring the deepest
obsessions of their life into their art &mdash; not in a direct way. A poet
who is drunk doesn't necessarily write Odes to Bacchus. A painter who
loves whores doesn't have to paint whores in order to express in art
what it is in himself that makes him love them. He may be able to
express this better by painting duchesses or cats or velvet-curtained
rooms.
   <p>In painting whores and entertainers, Lautrec was choosing to
paint those whose body is their fortune. His own body was his
misfortune. He must have felt this all the more poignantly for not
having been a cripple from birth, but from an age, fourteen, by which
he had acquired some relish in using his body, in riding and shooting.
   <p>He must have suffered not only from knowing what a monster he was
to look at, but also from the uselessness to himself of his distorted
body. This perhaps is what gave him a fascination with bodies that
were agile, bodies that could do what was asked of them, and bodies
that others wanted to use.
   <p>At the same time, he needed to reassure himself about his own
deformity with his consciousness that these bodies also would in time
become, as his had, useless and hideous and unwanted, and that they
would become so through the very exploitation of their desirability.
   <p>Lautrec's vision of his women is, I think, the outcome of some
such ambivalence as this: on the one hand, celebration of their easy
animal vigour and grace; on the other, celebration of the knowledge
that they too would fall into decrepitude. For it is not a present
state of decay that Lautrec presents as a rule, but only an intimation
of decay.
<head>Partaking of vitality</head>
   <p>He isn't at all Swiftian about women: he doesn't, getting
close, rejoice in recoiling from their enlarged pores. He paints them
as desirable &mdash; not glamourised, but desirable as women are in the
flesh. His women are excitingly depraved, but they aren't sick, they
are anything but sick; they convey a terrific sense of well-being.
And they are drawn with a longing to share in that well-being, as if
the painter, by transmitting to canvas the tautness and flexibility
and plasticity of their limbs, were by this somehow partaking of their
vitality.
   <p>He is no moralist, then; he doesn't use art as a means of
revenge. He is no Expressionist, inflicting (like those Central
European artists who have borrowed from his style and iconography)
upon the appearance of his whores an idea of their inner corruption,
making their bodies reflect the supposed state of their souls. He
paints them in all their ambiguity. He paints the presence of their
beautiful vitality, the promise of their decay, the process of
transition between them.
   <p>The artist he resembles most closely in spirit is, I think,
Watteau. Watteau, dangerously delicate in health, paints a world of
pleasure in which the threat of death is as surely present as in those
medieval images in which skeletons dance among the ladies of the
court. Lautrec, misshapen and useless, paints the agile and usable
bodies of women who are well aware that they are on the way to being
used-up. The transience of youth is the common theme, and Lautrec as
much as Watteau is a truly tragic artist in that he communicates not
only the certainty of loss but the sense of how much there is to lose.
   <p>The Arts Council show of paintings and drawings at the Tate is
not a major exhibition. It consists of a selection of works from the
Toulouse-Lautrec Museum at Albi, France, plus a score of things from
other collections in France and England. The Albi contribution,
helped by Mr. Jeffress's portrait of Emile Bernard, makes the
representation of the early work as strong as could be wished: it
shows how his art was based on a wonderfully sure grasp of form in the
round. There are a number of notable drawings and sketches. But of
his finest paintings there are no more than a handful.
<head>AT THE GALLERIES</head>
<head>Brave New Age of Bronze</head>
<head>By NEVILE WALLIS</head>
   <p>RODIN'S ghost will not be laid. It is that old master's
energy and rugged form, rather than his aspirations, which have
influenced two of the three conspicuous sculptors this week: Ralph
Brown (Leicester Galleries) and the American Jack Zajac (Roland,
Browse's).
   <p>Ralph Brown began as a social realist sculptor infusing
tenderness into a gawky mother fondling a child, an infant bowling a
hoop. His responsiveness to the earthy human being, often in turning
or more lively movement, is well seen in the swing of an adolescent
girl and in some fine figure drawings. But recently his sculptural
conceptions, carried out in ciment fondu for bronze, have
become more complex. His search now is for a metaphor for the human
figure. Preserving the human attributes in out-thrust scrawny limbs
and references to the ribbed torso, his images also resemble the
growth of trees. Thus his forms have become bunched, with knobbly
casing and clefts hard to read anatomically, and with lean stumpy
extremities.
   <p>
   <p>THIS WORKS well in the more fluid forms of his swimmers where
the whole emphasis is on their gliding motion or contortions. It
doesn't work, I think, in the arbitrary protrusions of the trunks of
his humanistic standing figures. Henry Moore's stylisation is
entirely consistent when one recognises that the twist of a worn
ridged pebble has suggested the bony structure of a figure as
timeless. Brown's distortions, on the other hand, seem superimposed
on the anatomical structure of his statue of a man with a child on his
shoulders, whose first impression of brute strength yields to a sense
of uncertain architecture and even pretentiousness. The search for a
synthesis, a metaphor for tough masculinity, continues. Brown is
happiest here in recent reliefs as sensitive as the shapes of his
swimmers surfacing.
   <p>Whereas Brown gropes ambitiously and often clumsily, Jack Zajac
seems perfectly assured. This young sculptor from Ohio has worked in
Rome, and the exuberant baroque of his prancing hybrid figures is as
clearly Italianate as his rugged porters are Rodinesque. Italy has
moulded the elegance of his bronze forms, elegantly mannered even when
the theme is as violent as a sacrificial goat trapped by a stake. The
volumes and agitated silhouettes in this Easter Goat series are always
expressive. The drama of imminent death reaches its climax in the
cruciform design of the beast with rearing neck and spreadeagled legs
against the long goad. One admires the inventive interplay of hard,
tusky forms and vulnerable belly without being in the least moved by
the torture. Aplomb is a cooling quality.
   <p>
   <p>MORE mature than either, with a certainty of architectonic
design still denied to Brown, F. E. McWilliam held me longest
with his recent bronzes sparely arranged at Waddington's galleries. I
was quite unsympathetic to his earlier surrealist figures, dismembered
and reassembled, their capriciousness masking for me the
reflectiveness of his mind. From these carvings he moved on to metal
totem figures, two of these aloof, highly wrought effigies standing
here as a reminder of them. His more recent shield-like emblems or
icons yield their dark spell without the demonstrativeness of
Paolozzi's encrusted objects.
   <p>They are deliberately frontal in aspect. Their intricately
textured and symbolic relief sometimes appears positive on the front,
negative on the back surface. The mood is equivocal, more capricious
in small variations of cult objects, contemplative in his large
bronzes. McWilliam may be unconscious of the distinction, for his
appeal is to different levels of consciousness. A trinity of figures
communes in the hollow of a great saucer. A beacon seen on the shore
becomes transfigured into an ominous signal-cum-lookout post. A
Corinthian helmet inspires an exploration of hollow form, with the
inscrutable menace of the visor still preserved. His personality is
impressed on every delphic image.
   <p>How it is that Celtic mystery and individual beauty can coalesce
in a flaky, metal shield on prongs is hard to say in simple terms. It
is simplest to say that McWilliam's restless fancy has found
fulfilment in his most satisfying sculptures to date.
<head>The Supremacy of Personality</head>
<head>THE CHARACTERS OF LOVE. By John Bayley. (Constable. 21s.)</head>
<head>By PHILIP TOYNBEE</head>
   <p>THE ambiguous title reveals, by the end of this book, a
depth of meaning. <quote>Love,</quote> writes Mr. Bayley, <quote>is the
potentiality of men and women which keeps them most interested in each
other.</quote> And later, writing of his reasons for choosing <quote>Troilus
and Criseyde,</quote> <quote>Othello</quote> and <quote>The Golden Bowl</quote> to illustrate
his thesis, he has this to say:-

<quote>
   <p>Their achievement becomes more impressive and their status more
clear if we realise how decisive in all of them is the idea of a
conflict of sympathies, the kind of conflict which can only be set up
by an opposition of characters of the old kind.
<QUOTE/>

   <p>In a sense the theme of love is secondary to Mr. Bayley's main
purpose, which is to vindicate his faith in <quote>the supremacy of
personality in the greatest literature.</quote>
   <p>It is a theme, of course, which is extremely familiar. Countless
old Dickensian hacks have been bemoaning Pickwick and Micawber ever
since novelists and critics first began their resolute march in a
different direction. But the point about Mr. Bayley's book, which
makes it, I believe, a critical work of the first importance, is that
he is a man of great intelligence and deep reading who is very well
aware of all the arguments which have been used against his position.
He is, in the literal sense, a reactionary; and he is reacting with
passion and intellect against some of the principal assumptions of
modern criticism and modern fictional practice.
   <p>
   <p>IT IS impossible to summarise the long chapters in which
Mr. Bayley has investigated the chosen illustrations of his theme.
I shall allow him, where possible, to speak for himself. Of
Chaucer's poem and its origins he has this to say:-

<quote>
   <p>All these &lsqb;qualities in Boccaccio&rsqb; Chaucer modifies in some way,
throwing round them a haze of the atypical and the individual.
Whereas everything in Boccaccio is hard, elegant and general, in
Chaucer it is muted, peculiar, full of objects that are unexpected and
yet oddly characteristic.
<QUOTE/>

   <p><quote>Othello,</quote> for Mr. Bayley, <quote>has a subtle and singular
function, unique among Shakespeare's plays, and in its peculiar blend
of effect reminds us ... of the novel.</quote> And against the many
hostile critics of the play he suggests that they have adopted the
false premise of supposing <quote>that the great play should be impersonal,
that the quirks and undercurrents of individual psychology should be
swallowed up in a grand tragic generality.</quote>
   <p>As for <quote>The Golden Bowl,</quote> among many other personalising
qualities which he finds in it, Mr. Bayley praises the novel
because:-

<quote>
   <p>Not only are the details of personal appearance and of town and
country landscape selected with a vividness and subtlety unmatched in
the James canon, but the physical nature of life is recorded with
unique emphasis.

<head>BOOK REVIEWS</head>
<head>Raglan's Sorry Role in the Crimea</head>
<head>THE DESTRUCTION OF LORD RAGLAN: A Tragedy of the Crimean War. By
Christopher Hibbert. (Longmans. 30s.)</head>
<head>By RAYMOND MORTIMER</head>
   <p>THERE never was a Crimean War: the whole story must be the
invention of some satirist frantic with hatred for warfare and
aristocracy. So at least I felt more strongly than ever when reading
the book under review. Not that Mr. Hibbert denounces our
Government for feebly drifting into so unnecessary a war: his account
of its origins is restricted to three colourless pages, for he writes
as a military historian concerned only with the conduct of the
campaign. The picture that emerges is often, however, too horrid to
seem credible.
   <p>To vindicate Lord Raglan, the Commander-in-Chief, is his
purpose &mdash; as it was Kinglake's; but Kinglake was animated also with
hatred of Napoleon 3, with whose mistress he had been in love; and
Mr. Hibbert is not biased by frustrated desire. His book seems to
me far the most trustworthy account yet written of the Crimean
campaign. It is based upon vast research into unpublished material,
including not only the Raglan papers but hundreds of letters from
obscure fighting men. He quotes also from Russian books that have not
been translated.
<head>Cowardly Government</head>
   <p>THE battles are described in great detail and illustrated
with the usual plans &mdash; rectangles showing troop-positions among
vermiculated hills. Readers who share my distrust of such tactical
exegesis must not skip the superb account of Inkerman with its
hand-to-hand tussles in the fog. Unfortunately the author throws
little light upon the military departments at home, which with their
archaic incompetence and divided responsibilities were chiefly to
blame for the suffering of the troops. Otherwise he has been
admirably thorough; and the writing is lucid, correct and lively.
   <p>Our exceptionally pacific Government declared war only because it
had not the courage to resist the jingoism of the public and the
newspapers. The pretext was an invasion of what is now Rumania by
Russian troops, who were quickly expelled by the Turks with no help
from us. However, having sent an army as far as Turkey, we felt
something or other must be done with it, and the Crimean port of
Sebastopol seemed easy to capture. After over a year of fighting
captured it was, but with no lasting advantage to us or our allies.
The jaunt cost the lives of over half a million men.
   <p>Experienced Generals from our Indian Army were available, but
they did not belong to the nobility: and so the commands were given to
men who had seen active service, if at all, not less than thirty-nine
years previously. Two of them suffered from feeble eyesight; one
refused to wear spectacles. An officer could bring unlimited luggage,
his wife, his French cook, and a yacht to live in; there were not even
tents for the men, and what little equipment they were given was for
the most part shoddy, boots that fell to pieces, swords so soft that
they would bend instead of cutting.
<head>Rotting Cargoes</head>
   <p>THOUGH we boasted far the largest navy and mercantile
marine in the world, these could not bring enough supplies for our
expeditionary force; and cargoes moreover were allowed to rot
unloaded. The two admirals were at odds with one another. The
commissioners in charge of supplies, when asked for a few nails,
refused to issue less than a ton. Half-starved and unprotected
against the Russian winter, our troops died in their thousands: lack
of fodder killed the horses and mules; there was no other transport.
The C.O. of the Grenadiers would not allow a mere line regiment
to fight on the flank of his beautiful Guardsmen, who were therefore
compelled to retreat in disorder.
   <p>Officers like Lord Cardigan and Lord George Paget found the war
so disagreeable that they returned to England in a huff. Of course
no such escape was possible for the men, who at first fought with
staggering courage. Gradually those who survived grew bitter; the
reinforcements were for the most part raw recruits; morale collapsed.
In the final action at Sebastopol our troops refused the order to
advance; and the fortress was taken by the French, who throughout the
campaign had been better equipped, better fed and better led.
   <p>Worn out by his labours, insulted in Parliament and by the Press,
no longer supported by his Queen, Raglan had died three months
previously. A wiser man would not have accepted the command at the
age of sixty-five after forty years of sitting at a desk. He did
accept it, not from conceit but from a sense of duty. No one could
have been more courageous, more hard-working, more fair-minded, more
amiable. He behaved to the French with exemplary and invaluable
patience. But then he proved equally patient with the military
departments at home that were murdering his troops. He could not bear
to say an unkind word to anyone.
<head>Creature of Habit</head>
   <p>WE cannot refuse him our pity. He worked himself to death
at a Herculean task for which he was fitted by neither character nor
experience. We must remember at the same time that he had been for
the previous twenty-eight years Secretary at the Horse Guards
apparently without attempting any reform in the administration of the
Army. He was described by Palmerston as <quote>a creature of habit</quote>; and
in the Crimea he found himself a victim of the grotesque system he had
helped to maintain. The conservative who dislikes changes even when
they are improvements may, like Raglan, be a good man. He cannot be a
good Commander-in-Chief.
<head>IRON DUKE ON PAPER</head>
<head>WELLINGTON AT WAR. Letters selected and edited by Anthony
Brett-James. (Macmillan. 42s.)</head>
<head>By SIR ARTHUR BRYANT</head>
   <p>NOT even Dr. Johnson could hit a verbal nail on the head
more effectively than the Duke of Wellington. He once said that there
was nothing in life like a clear definition, and during his years of
command he was incessantly engaged in defining things clearly. It was
one of the qualities that made him so great a commander; as with
Field-Marshal Montgomery it was almost impossible to mistake his
meaning, however unpalatable. As the human capacity for getting the
wrong end of the stick, especially in the fog and confusion of war, is
almost infinite, this quality is an essential part of the military
art.
   <p>If good writing be the art of conveying meaning with the greatest
possible force in the fewest possible words &mdash; and I can think of no
better definition &mdash; Wellington was a very good writer. His military
correspondence, like his recorded conversation, is delightful reading.
   <p>
   <p><quote>IT is not very agreeable to anybody,</quote> he reminded a
complaining Portuguese magnate, <quote>to have strangers quartered in his
house; nor is it very agreeable to us strangers, who have good houses
in our own country, to be obliged to seek for quarters here. We are
not here for our pleasure; the situation of your country renders it
necessary.</quote> Could anything be neater?
   <p>Or anything more true than this? <quote>Half the business of the
world, particularly that of our country, is done by accommodation and
by the parties understanding each other.</quote>
   <p>Or this, quoted by Mr. Brett-James in his admirable
introduction &mdash; <quote>I do not know how Mr&hellip; . has discovered that my
channels of intelligence are of doubtful fidelity. I should find it
very difficult to point out what channels of intelligence I have: but
probably Mr&hellip; . knows.</quote>
   <p>
   <p>MR. BRETT-JAMES has done modern readers &mdash; who turn to the
great classics of our past too little &mdash; a service by producing a new
selection from Wellington's letters. Most of them are taken from
twelve volumes and two and a half million words of Colonel Gurwood's
<quote>Dispatches of the Duke of Wellington</quote> and from the fifteen volumes
of the Duke's <quote>Supplementary Dispatches.</quote>
   <p>I will not say that no better selection could have been made;
Mr. Brett-James's book does not compare, for instance, with the much
fuller selection made by Colonel Gurwood himself and published in
early Victorian days in a single volume of nearly a thousand pages.
In deference to the reading tastes of our day Mr. Brett-James's
compass is far smaller.
   <p>The truth is that at least a dozen selections of equal size,
equally good and equally representative, could have been made from the
same source. What matters is that the editor has given us the essence
of Wellington's genius &mdash; his clarity, his good sense, his powers of
observation, his understanding of human nature, his dry irony, his
wonderful balance and foresight. It is like offering the reader a
small parcel of a superb cellar; it is all there for his buying if he
wants more.
   <p>I cannot help adding one sample of Wellington's style. He had
been approached about the return to England of a major whose fianc&eacute;e
was pining in his absence.

   <p><quote>I cannot say that I have ever known of a young lady dying of
love. They contrive, in some manner, to live and look tolerably well,
notwithstanding their despair and the continued absence of their
lover; and some even have been known to recover so far as to be
inclined to take another lover, if the absence of the first has lasted
too long. I don't suppose that your prot&eacute;g&eacute;e can ever
recover so far, but I do hope that she will survive the continued
necessary absence of the Major, and enjoy with him here-after many
happy days.</quote>

<head>ADVICE FOR A LADY IN LOVE</head>
<head>TO A YOUNG ACTRESS: The Letters of Bernard Shaw to Molly
Tompkins. (Constable. 63s.)</head>
<head>By HESKETH PEARSON</head>
   <p>FOR sheer entertainment and humorous common sense the
letters and criticisms of Bernard Shaw are unrivalled. Much of their
scintillation and gaiety is due to his emotional detachment from life,
and his peculiar genius derives from the fact that, being removed from
the complicated agitations of ordinary human beings, he could observe
with cool clarity the actions resulting from their temperamental
disturbances.
   <p>This oddity in his nature appears again and again in his letters
to women, who fell in love with him and had to be coaxed out of their
enraptured condition. One of them, a young actress named Molly
Tompkins, arrived in England from America with her husband and small
son, for the sole purpose of meeting the prophet Shaw, who sent her
well over a hundred letters and post-cards between 1921 and his death.
   <p>
   <p><quote>IS it not delightful, to be in love?</quote> he wrote to her;
<quote>it has happened to me twice. It does not last, because it does not
belong to this earth; and when you clasp the idol it turns out to be a
rag doll like yourself; for the immortal part must elude you if
you grab at it.</quote> But while he was content with dreams of fair
women, they were looking for something more corporeal, which he could
only supply by giving them excellent advice on how to order their
lives.
   <p>
   <p>IN this handsome volume many of his letters to Molly
Tompkins are reproduced in photostat. With a few alterations carbon
copies could have been sent to any of his adoring female
correspondents without surprising them. They contain advice on such
matters as the disadvantage of an actress using make-up off the stage
and the advantage of using it when interviewing managers, on the
correct pronunciation of words, on how to behave as a mother and the
proper way to bring up a son, on the process of buying white oxen in
Italy, on the necessity in England of putting <quote>Esq.</quote> not
<quote>Mr.</quote> on envelopes addressed to men, on how to catch a bat, and
on the expediency of keeping a parrot instead of a dog: <quote>Parrots are
amusing, and never die. You wish they did.</quote>
   <p>Frequently in these letters his intuition or observation is
crystallised in a phrase, e.g., ~<quote>Learning to live is like
learning to skate: you begin by making a ridiculous spectacle of
yourself,</quote> and ~<quote>The fear of God may be the beginning of wisdom,
but the fear of Man is the beginning of murder,</quote> and ~<quote>It is
useless to try to help people whom God does not mean to be helped.</quote>

<head>FICTION</head>
<head>Keeping The Beasts In Their Place</head>
<head>By NIGEL DENNIS</head>
<head>ANGUS WILSON, The Old Men at the Zoo. Secker &amp; Warburg, 18s.</head>
   <p><quote>OUR island, it would appear, is too small to allow even
for the controlled return of the wolf, the bear and the boar.</quote>
   <p>So says the Times &mdash; or rather, Angus Wilson makes the Times say
so in his new novel, which is set in London in 1970. There is no
reason to doubt that his sober, careful verdict on the danger of
<quote>open</quote> Zoos catches exactly the tone of the Times of 1970; but we
are left worrying about Mr. Wilson himself. He has written the
future <quote>editorial.</quote> He has written the present novel. Are they at
odds with one another?
   <p>The matter is mentioned because the puzzle of Mr. Wilson's new
novel is to know clearly what he is saying and where he is standing.
This was never a problem in Mr. Wilson's early days. His first
books of short stories were as clear as only crystals of poison can
be, and the horrors he held up to our inspection were almost too
recognisable to be faced.
   <p>But, since then, Mr. Wilson has widened both his medium and his
heart. He writes big novels now and expresses his griefs and pains
quite openly; he still has plenty of poison, but he doles it out with
a more distressed hand &mdash; in brief, he is no longer a pure satirist.
   <p>One may mourn the change, but one has no right to condemn it. An
author should be allowed to change as he pleases: the only test is the
quality of the result.
   <p>The Old Men at the Zoo has much to commend it. It has been
written with great feeling and it has some very enjoyable characters
in it. It is also a very just book, in that the most absurd
characters are allowed their virtues and dignities. Even when it is
cross, angry and spiteful, it is still a kindly book.
   <p>The difficulty is to know exactly how to find one's way about in
it. The title suggests that it is about the English masses (who are
<quote>the Zoo</quote>) and those who govern them (who are <quote>the old men</quote>).
If this is correct, then much of Mr. Wilson's symbolism becomes
easy to follow. We see clearly that if the Zoo is to be decently
conducted, those who govern it must do so unselfishly, intelligently
and civilisedly.
   <p>
   <p>They must also realise that animals are tricky, even dangerous,
beasts, and must not feel sentimental about tarantulas and lynxes.
   <p>The chiefs of Mr. Wilson's Zoo lack most of these
qualifications. Some of them are idealists &mdash; in the sense that they
are more obsessed with theories and dreams about animals than they are
with actual, living animals. Others of them love only those aspects
of the animal that suit their professional interests &mdash; an extreme (and
witty) example is the Zoo pathologist, who loves animals most when
they are dead, dissection being his forte.
   <p>These persons, let us say, are the department chiefs and top
bureaucrats of our society &mdash; and under them are the <quote>keepers</quote> and
<quote>assistant-keepers</quote> who carry out their orders. But above them all
are the Secretary and the Director &mdash; men of nearly equal power who
frame Zoo policy and fight over what this policy should be; these two
we may call Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition.
   <p>The clash of policy in Mr. Wilson's novel is over the Zoo of
the future. The Director hates Regent's Park: he believes that
animals must be given <quote>limited liberty</quote> and allowed to roam in
Whipsnadian reserves. The Secretary thinks this is nonsense.
Animals, he insists, are best off in the cosy, though somewhat
cramped, cages designed for them by the great Victorian, Decimus
Burton.
   <p>All this is most prettily done. Mr. Wilson's descriptions of
animals are first-rate &mdash; particularly as he is most honest about them,
never pretending for a moment that some of them are extremely ugly.
And the problems these animals present are perfectly genuine ones:
should <quote>the wolf, the bear and the boar</quote> be allowed considerable
liberty, or is the Times right in concluding that they are too
dangerous to enjoy such privileges?
   <p>This problem becomes acutely personal to every reader when a
liberated wolf eats the Director's daughter. Thousands of innocent
animals have to pay for the wolf's indiscretion by being shut up in
Regent's Park again. Is this fair?
   <p>Mr. Wilson does not say whether it is fair or not. And by the
end of the book we realise that the puzzles and hypotheses which he
presents are honest expressions of his own uncertainty. His intention
is not to provide closed answers, but to proffer dozens of open
questions.
   <p>
   <p>This is unusual and stimulating in theory, but tending to
confusion in practice. Mr. Wilson's novel, one feels, would have
been remarkably good if he had stuck strictly to the Zoo. Instead, he
has filled out his canvas of the future with a war in which England is
invaded and crushed by combined European armies (Russia and America
agree not to intervene). He has put in saboteurs, and spies, and
politicians, and resistance movements &mdash; and by the time he has done he
has put in more matter than he can handle and made an artistic clutter
of his humane worries.
   <p>His novel is still a good one &mdash; but the careful, precise pen of
the former short-story writer could have made his parable shorter,
clearer and far more brilliant.

   <p>FOR topicality, Alasdair Clayre's first novel The Window
would stand out emphatically enough at any time beside this week's
other books; in the present condition of the world it is almost too
much.
   <p>The central figures are a decent, devout, inarticulate organist
in a poor district of Portsmouth, his frigid, respectable wife and
their sons, Peter, a trumpet-playing factory worker, and Matthew, a
pretty batman whose ambition is to be a butler.
   <p>Also involved are the step-children of the vicarage: James, an
elaborately cerebral philosopher, and Anna, a bemused, sensitive
pianist. The organist, Matthew and James get caught up, in different
ways and with fatal consequences for one of them, in the Easter March
of an idealistic organisation.
   <p>
   <p>The narrative is developed with great skill and efficiency, the
point of view shifting from one of the main characters to another. In
its course Mr. Clayre conducts his readers on a convincingly
authoritative tour of a wide variety of pre-eminently contemporary
scenes: an assembly-line, an officers' mess, a jazz club, a left-wing
coffee-bar, a deb dance, as well as the March itself.
   <p>It is an impressively copious image of our society, but its
realism has the thinness of a cross-section. The Sands family are not
very plausible as a group; even the accelerated social mobility of our
time could hardly accommodate a son like Peter in such a family.
   <p>James is an Englishman's idea of a young Frenchman, and Matthew
seems to have been transferred from one of Simon Raven's amazing
regiments. There is a fairly sharp line between these and the
characters Mr. Clayre likes, the organist and Anna for example, who
are honoured with a less rigid and political treatment. But this is
an able and intelligent book whose limitations reflect the magnitude
of its ambitions.
   <p>The Mighty and their Fall is absolutely standard Ivy
Compton-Burnett, another elegant construction in moral geometry,
another variation on her insulated domestic theme with its normal
elements of dubious paternity, hidden wills, a despised governess,
gnomic servants and Hobbesian toddlers.
   <p>Experts could no doubt identify most of the characters and
situations with those of earlier books and even the less initiated can
see that this one involves no striking new departures. Miss
Compton-Burnett's curious instrument grates on some ears, but for
those who can stand it there is more to be got from it than the
incidental felicities to be discovered by brief dippings. Her books
should be read at a sitting if possible, since the plot and characters
are only revealed by the cumulative effect of the dialogue.
   <p>The centre of this novel is the struggle between a widowed father
and his eldest daughter who both resort to deceit, she to prevent his
second marriage, he to prevent her inheriting his brother's money. He
has a more impersonal justification in his concern for the continuing
welfare of the estate but it gives his response to exposure a more
blatant and so more discreditable quality.
   <p>Miss Compton-Burnett's vertiginous economies both of technique
and material have a charm of their own and there is a fascination in
what she manages to do with what is left; but they also reflect, as
much as Racine's, a judgment of importance, of what really matters in
the relations of human beings.
   <p>
   <p>Howard Spring's I Met a Lady is, predictably and honourably,
a thoroughly good read &mdash; the whole quarter of a million words of it.
A rambling, loose-jointed affair, it seems to be the result of
throwing a few human types together at random to see what would come
out.
   <p>The hero escapes from Manchester and cotton with an inheritance
that allows him to indulge his pronounced negative capability as a
writer of little essays. After a good deal of dithering he marries a
nice rich actress and what with her connections and the family of a
tycoon who unaccountably becomes his friend he has plenty to look in
upon and make harmlessly facetious remarks about. It is a
pleasant-spirited, old-fashioned book and pretends to do no more than
tell an only mildly engrossing story.
   <p><quote>H. D.</quote>'s Bid Me to Live, a small, handsomely-produced
volume, is described as <quote>a madrigal of war-time love and death in the
London of 1917.</quote> It recounts in short, hectic and often verbless
sentences the inner life of Julia Ashton, a sensitive American married
to Rafe, who spends his leaves in the bed of the girl upstairs. Julia
wrongly thinks that Frederick, a red-bearded author of <quote>scandalous,
volcanic novels</quote> married to an ample German aristocrat, is in love
with her.
   <p>The clef of this roman is ready to hand, and it bears
the imprint not, as the blurb says, of major literature, but of a
major litt&eacute;rateur. In its undisciplined artiness it is of a
piece with the odd, vanished world it obliquely describes.

   <p>Family Jewels BY PETRU DUMITRIU, Collins, 21s. First
part of mighty trilogy about peasants revolting against landed gentry

<head>THE WORLD OF MUSIC</head>
<head>A Drastic Way with Verdi</head>
<head>By DESMOND SHAWE-TAYLOR</head>
   <p>THE score of <quote>Falstaff</quote> seems to have ripened against a
warm orchard wall. It is all juice and goodness, firm flesh and sweet
tang: at once earthy and heavenly, mellow and zestful, old and young.
This is one of music's miracles; and the miracle was achieved by
Boito's cunning and Verdi's genius upon the basis of an effective but
prosaic Shakespearean farce.
   <p>Franco Zeffirelli's new production, unveiled at Covent Garden
last Wednesday, was eagerly awaited after his romantic <quote>Lucia</quote> and
his wonderfully brilliant <quote>Cav</quote> and <quote>Pag</quote> at the same house &mdash;
not to mention his more controversial <quote>Romeo and Juliet</quote> at the Old
Vic. His <quote>Falstaff,</quote> though likely to prove a hit, is again
controversial. Visually, it is inventive and often lovely.
Dramatically, it is a hotchpotch: imaginative, eccentric, frequently
crude.
   <p>
   <p>THE worst comes near the beginning. If you can accept the
short opening scene between Falstaff and his followers, the evening
has no further terrors for you. The style here is that of the Crazy
Gang, though without their sublime impudence; for if Messrs.
Naughton and Gold had played Pistol and Bardolph, they would at least
have stormed the Royal Box and tried on a tiara. Michael Langdon and
Robert Bowman could only rampage and roister around the stage, though
<quote>only</quote> is a poor word, for they achieved a good deal. For
instance, Geraint Evans's admirable delivery of the Honour tirade was
effectively diminished when to each one of Falstaff's rhetorical
questions Bardolph, from beneath a table or halfway up the stairs,
insisted on nodding a tireless and zany affirmative.
   <p>Thence to Ford's garden, a sort of inn courtyard: striking.
Enter two letter-carrying Wives (Mariella Angioletti and Josephine
Veasey), a Dutch-doll Nannetta (Mirella Freni) and... but who is this,
sweeping in, last and grandest, like a beruffed Lady Bracknell, with
parasol at the slope and lorgnettes at the ready? Can it be our old
friend Mrs. Quickly, servant to Dr. Caius and Eastcheap hostess?
Of course, she runs the entire show; the only surprise is that she
didn't get a letter too. If so wild a misinterpretation can be
tolerated, she is capitally sung and played by the exuberant Regina
Resnik.
   <p>That Mrs. Ford hardly got a look in was to some extent the
fault of Signora Angioletti, who on the first night continually
allowed her phrases to vanish in mid-utterance as though the current
had been cut off. The explanation can hardly be a failure of voice,
for a few bars later all was well again; I fear it must have been Art.
   <p>
   <p>IN the second act things began to improve, although Mrs.
Quickly's famous deep curtseys on the word <quote>\Reverenza!</quote> were
turned into nonsense by having to be executed on a staircase. Best of
all was the great scene between Ford and Falstaff, where no misplaced
ingenuity was allowed to impair our pleasure in the excellent singing
of John Shaw and Mr. Evans and in the brilliant and zestful playing
of the orchestra under Signor Giulini. The orchestra was throughout
in splendid form; particularly at the quiet end of Act 3, Scene 1,
where the empty stage and darkening sky, the calling of the distant
voices, the magical chain of descending harmonies and the slowly
closing curtains were combined by producer and conductor into an
exquisite theatrical unity.
   <p>The tapestried interior of Ford's house made a delightful
spectacle, and the final scene opened in a vein of high romance, with
pale shafts of moonlight striking across the forest glade; but on the
arrival of the fairies Herne's Oak split asunder and soared aloft,
never to be seen again. We found ourselves back in the inn
courtyard &mdash; but a courtyard transformed into such a dream-pageant as
might have been conjured up by a Chagall given unlimited funds to
stage a party for Mr. Bestegui or Mr. Onassis.
   <p>Somewhere in the course of all this &mdash; the clowning and the
prettiness, the slapstick and whimsy and phantasmagoria &mdash; Verdi's
simplicity and honesty have fallen by the wayside. But the
compensations are great, especially on the musical side &mdash; and I fear
it is the kind of showy production that makes such a phrase seem
natural. Great pleasure is given by Luigi Alva and Signora Freni as
the young lovers. Signor Giulini excels in the purely lyrical music,
and the details are always handled with loving care; where breadth and
robustness are demanded he is sometimes less happy. Mr. Evans
continues to ripen and improve his distinguished Falstaff, but we
cannot expect to see this impersonation at its best until it figures
within a less confusing framework.
   <p>
   <p>THE Welsh National Opera Company began an enterprising week
of opera at Sadler's Wells with two much earlier Verdi operas: the
<quote>Nabucco</quote> of 1842 and <quote>La Battaglia di Legnano</quote> of 1849.
Both were accompanied by the Bournemouth Orchestra and conducted by
Charles Groves with no very marked feeling for the appropriate style.
<quote>Nabucco</quote> was in all essentials the production that has been seen
in London twice before, but it is now distinguished by a new Abigail
(Elizabeth Vaughan) who tackled her very difficult music with
remarkable aplomb and accuracy, if she can enrich her timbre she might
go far. Both operas are full of stirring choral scenes, sung
vigorously but with a faulty sense of legato by the Welsh choir.
   <p>Drastic treatment was again meted out to Verdi in <quote>La
Battaglia di Legnano,</quote> which lost all connection with what the
Press statement called <quote>a rather dated incident in the 12th
century</quote> and was lugged forward into modern times by John Moody, to
become an episode of the Italian Resistance during the German
occupation. Modern diction and ways of thought were, however, not
consistently adopted. In one of Verdi's furious cabalettas (husband
discovering wife's supposed infidelity) ~<quote>Trema! trema! coppia
esecrata!</quote> became ~<quote>Damn you! damn you! pair of dirty liars!</quote>;
but when the wife popped a compromising letter into her <quote>bosom</quote>
(standard post-box for operatic missives), it instantly <quote>stung her
like a serpent.</quote>
   <p>Notwithstanding such quaint distractions, the power and the
beauty of Verdi's invention in the last two acts could be perceived.
The best singing came from Heather Harper.
   <p>The Welsh Opera continues to deserve our gratitude, but could
learn much in the way of vocal style from a surprisingly vocal
performance of Rossini's <quote>Otello</quote> by the Philopera Circle at St.
Pancras on Friday, about which I hope to add a word or two next week.
<head>WELSH NIGHT</head>
   <p>Between them, Cardiff and St. Pancras ensure that not a
note written by Verdi remains unheard in London. Meanwhile, thanks to
the Welsh National Opera Company for bringing, if only for a single
May night, another Rimsky-Korsakov opera to Sadler's Wells, a theatre
which knew <quote>Snow Maiden</quote> and <quote>Tsar Saltan</quote> in pre-war days.
   <p><quote>May Night,</quote> a folksy precursor of the more sophisticated
orientalisms of <quote>Sadko</quote> and <quote>The Golden Cockerel,</quote> proved a
happy choice, with the pleasing voices of John Wakefield (Levko), Iona
Jones (Anna) and Heather Harper (Queen of the Roussalki) well-suited
to its melodic grace. The male topers, too, Harold Blackburn, Laurie
Payne and Stephen Manton, entered into the spirit of the piece, but
not Phyllis Ash Child's completely un-shrewish Sister-in-law.
   <p>Sally Hulke's sets and John Moody's production, like the chorus,
provided more acceptable contributions than the Bournemouth Symphony
Orchestra, whose neat rhythmic response to Charles Makerras's
conducting was too often wide of the mark in pitch.
   <p>Boito's <quote>Mefistofele</quote> remains the Company's most imaginative
production. Triumphing ingeniously over space, it depicts Heaven and
a Witches' Sabbath as successfully as Faust's study. Raimund Herinex
has, again, the right voice and manner for the Prince of Evil, but
rejuvenation brings Tano Ferendino's Faust no increased vocal
confidence. Under Warwick Braithwaite the orchestra recovered pitch,
while sagging intonation crossed the footlights, weighing heavier on
the angelic chorus of the Prologue than their golden wings.
   <p>F. A.
<head>BALLET</head>
<head>By RICHARD BUCKLE</head>
<head>What Every Guru Knows</head>
   <p>ON Wednesday night, when my pampered colleagues were borne in
their capacious palanquins either to &mdash; Zeffirelli's (Verdi's
&lsqb;Shakespeare's&rsqb;) &mdash; <quote>Falstaff</quote> or to see those onychophorous
ootocoids at the Fortune, this Cinderella among critics made his way
alone and on foot to watch Indian dancing at La Scala in Charlotte
Street.
   <p>
   <p>NOW, though I would not go as far as to agree with the
programme that the technique of Kamala, the eldest of the three
sisters performing, <quote>is in the enveable position of being above
controversy,</quote> she has learnt some of Bharata Natya and she gets by.
Radha and Vasanti are graceful, too. It is how their brother Mr.
Kumar got on stage that beats me &mdash; unless, of course, he is really
Peter Sellers. From his performance, I guessed that, watching his kid
sisters perfecting themselves in their art, he suddenly couldn't bear
not to be in on it too, and finally forbade them to appear without
him. There can be no doubt that, like Romeo Coates, he believes
utterly in his mission. <quote>Dance inspires him ceaselessly to strive
higher and higher towards the shining pinnacle of perfection that is
the goal of every Artiste.</quote>
   <p>Kathak, with its swift spins, is what bedizened boys used to
dance before Mogul Emperors. Mr. Kumar rashly did it stripped to
the waist, his long hair arranged in an untidy bird's-nest. He never
got up much speed, and made few turns. What he did do was to fix us
with a basilisk stare, make odd pointing gestures and keep improvising
for about twenty minutes. A polite attempt to drive him offstage with
a burst of applause only spurred him to go on and on.
   <p>Eventually his attention wandered from his work, and his eye hit
on a ground mike near the footlights. He had a bright idea. He
stopped dancing, pulled the mike upstage and, indicating his anklets
of bells, told us <quote>Now I will make you hear one bell &mdash; just one
bell, not four hundred.</quote> Starting with the full carillon (if
someone had not turned off the mike we should have been deafened) he
went into a shuddering Antonio-type diminuendo. Even so I heard not
one bell, but at least six. Then he started dancing again.
